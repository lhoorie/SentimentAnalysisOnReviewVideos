"""https://youtu.be/E2UxQNcSiEE""",The Boogeyman,a 90-minute horror film based off of a 12-page Stephen King short story sure I mean work for Children of the Corn ER did I say work for Children of the Corn I meant sucked entirely though to be fair Children of the Corn was like 40 pages or so the boogeyman is the newest horror film that the studio either has all the faith in the world of because they're like look we're gonna come out this week with spider-verse or they're like look we're gonna try to bury this under spider-verse and it is so the trailer says an adaptation of the Stephen King's short and he does have a therapist and a boogeyman so there's that it still feels like someone on the production side was like we have the scripts Mr Stephen King you mind if we just say it's based off of your short story and then the conversation pretty much goes down like if you're good at something never do it for free how much you want so this film largely revolves around Sophie Thatcher and her family her sister played by Vivian Lyra Blair her father played by Chris Messina and the boogeyman is latched on to their family now at the beginning of this movie I was like this is creepy I'm in creepy Ambience good camera work great sound design because good horror means great sound design then from that awesome opening to the end is a consistent 90 minutes of diminishing returns not that it's all bad because it's not all bad at all what I liked about this movie is for the first half maybe two-thirds I felt that there was a solid attempt at being a psychological Thriller over horror I actually really like and appreciate that they could have gone for the Cheap Thrills but they didn't they're like psychological Horror family torment and pain it's a slow burn absolutely but a slow burn does not mean bad and then for the last act it's like they were like do we say Slow Burn we meant cliched horror movie nonsense that the audience has seen a million times before and that's a real bummer it's like the last Act to this movie diminishes the entire setup to it in terms of tone and Vibe at least how I was processing it because I said Slow Burn that's how it felt at the time but the difference between Slow Burn and slow comes down to the payoff in the end if you have great payoff that justifies that Slow Burn will slow burn it remains if you have cliche horror movie schlock in the end will that Slow Burn is now just slow and that's how this movie ended up feeling it was a real shame not that this movie didn't have positives within that last act I thought the creature design was interesting when you could see it but this thing is the Boogeyman it doesn't largely reside in the shadows it can only survive in light it's like you turn on the light it just kind of disappears which means in the last act when this thing is chasing them it's chasing them but it's all dark in this house and you can't see what's chasing them you couldn't use the situation to the advantage of the film it's dark it's Broody something's in the shadows stalking them sure and there are moments of that in here absolutely but having a Chase sequence with the lights out you just can't see what's chasing them so it feels like you're missing out on the chase sequence it's like they had the end the climax of this movie take place with the lights on it's almost like oh we established this thing can't survive in light you can't even see it in light all right we'll we'll have all the lights off doesn't really work but I'm not rewriting this thing this writer strike is coming man we gotta get this done I thought the acting was great Sophie Thatcher largely carries this film I thought she did a great job now Vivian Lyra Blair she played Little Princess Leia in the Obi-Wan series regardless of the flaws in the Obi-Wan series it was very clear she's a really good actor and for the sake of this film when you need little kid looking scared out of her mind whatever Boogeyman lurks in the darkness she absolutely sells it and the camera work that's going on when she is there's Talent here there's something great in this film it's just it's not the film by The End by the end it just walked out going all right I've seen that 100 times before didn't look like it was going that way could have been something special kind of feels like a kid who's sitting still in church because they've been told it's what they have to do and so they do but by the end of them sitting still they do it for 90 minutes or so maybe an hour of 90 minutes they feel the tension so much they just have to run and scream and get it out now that's what this movie felt like maybe it'll be a better time if you're drunk yeah that's a part  all right so the boogeyman have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought comment below let me know are you gonna you're gonna really watch this there's some spider verse and this is the one you're watching this week fair I won't tell you how to spend your money but if you haven't watched it what's a disappointing horror film that started out great and just ended up Matt whatever it is whatever you think comment below let me

"""https://youtu.be/W3QTHjSd5eg""",Spider,they crushed it so Spider-Man across the spider-verse is the sequel to the very successful widely beloved and Visually dazzling Spider-Man into the spider-verse this time around there's a super secret society of super Spider-Mans and Miles Morales is like I'm not a part of that there's a new villain called spot he's causing problems more development with Miles Morales and all the visual bedazzlement the first movie had that you're hoping the second movie has and absolutely yes it has it and you know what I liked about this film actually what I really appreciated about this film is it's across the spider verse we've all heard about these Spider-Man's cameos spider men's or Spider-Man or Spider-Man's his name is Spider-Man so I'm gonna go ahead and say Spider-Man's plural but lots of cameos right all the Spider-Man cameos Scarlet Spider Cameo admittedly as a Ben Reilly fan totally cool with that or 90s Ben Reilly fan anyway and they could have rested on that they could have been like cameos Easter eggs those are fun that carries the film also we're gonna blow their synapses out of the water with the visuals so that's enough we don't need more and has fun with that absolutely it has fun with the Easter eggs the visuals just blows your hair back but it doesn't lean on it too much if it didn't have the Easter eggs it still would have been an amazing film that's what that's supposed to be it's supposed to be icing on the cake not the whole cake I was actually surprised in the first hour or so in this film you get some web slinging absolutely but for the most part the heart and soul of it it's some really personal family Dynamic going on here Miles Morales as well as Gwen Stacy a lot more Gwen Stacy and her world her life than I was expecting from this film I appreciate that because that's a real question in a superhero film is how engaging is the film when costumes are not at play when you're dealing with the humans behind the mask and the answer here is very it's very engaging this movie is a gripping character piece that's also a superhero movie which those are my favorite superhero movies you know when into the spider-verse how Nicholas Cage as Noir Spider-Man kinda stole the show and he was just he was amazing in that respect this time around is Daniel kaluya voicing Hobie the world just needs more Hobie in everything they actually do a very interesting thing with the villain in here spots which the concept of Ally and enemy is a very complex issue in here which I feel is Spider-Man to the core it's very Spider-Man theme and it's in here it's alive and well in here but spot is one of those enemies could have been so done just comes across as a freak of the weak villain in a TV series somewhere and then this villain just grows as a problem and that was a huge problem and is actually kind of amazing granted the animation absolutely AIDS in making spot work it's part of the magic of the spider-verse animation and now we get to talk about that animation which is so unique it kind of reminds me of the first time I saw the Matrix where you walk out of the Matrix you're like visually that was just on another level and only the Matrix feels like the Matrix a very unique experience then other movies are like hey we'll incorporate some Matrix tactics into our movies and that's awesome because that's a film that changes the industry but still even after that only the Matrix feels like the Matrix same as spider-verse you've seen other animations incorporate spider-verse style animation in their animations but only a spider-verse film apparently feels like spider-verse it's like you can take any frame from across the spider verse granted you can take any frame from into the spider-verse as well but for the sake of this video in which this is a review for across the spider verse right you could blindly grab any frame from this movie and be like yep gonna blow that up that's a painting that's in my house and it'll look amazing also the visuals of the world were content with the character they're telling the story of like when you're with Gwen Stacy in her world it looks like the spider Gwen comic at least how I remember it looking then you're with Miles Morales and it looks different than that so it gives the visual style more character just outside the action the world itself has a visual aesthetic That's Unique it has its own flavor based on the character they're telling the story of at the time in the moment and I'll be honest with you I found out that this movie clocks in at 2 hours and 20 minutes essentially when I was at the theater about to watch the film I was like oh man is that gonna fail too long overall a product of our experience and lately when a movie clocks in at 2 hours 20 minutes two and a half hours it generally feels too long I always walk out of that movie being like they could have shaved time I did not feel like that here when this movie ends and it ends on that note of it's uh what that's where you end oh I can't wait for the third movie [ __ ] yeah I mean I can't see the future don't have a crystal ball or anything but I'm just saying that was definitely the feeling at the time that's the feeling I'm going to hold too until I'm in the theater watching the third film that's gonna stick with me but the other feeling I got was I could have actually been in this chair after two and a half hours of watching this movie they could have just rolled me into the next film for another two and a half hours and I would have been cool with that guys in the end Spider-Man across the spider verse is one word epic the voice acting is amazing Oscar Isaac as a Miguel Spider-Man 2099 dude the action feels intense it feels fast it feels heavy it's a fun action film absolutely but one that doesn't rely on the Multiverse for the sake of multi-first we've seen that a lot it's like Multiverse because Multiverse why Multiverse versus that multi because it's awesome this uses the Multiverse in a way that has personal Stakes with the main character involved it's an animation that shows how animation hits differently than live action but also shows why in some cases animation is just the better way to go it's a comic book movie that entertains you when the Great comic book [ __ ] is going down but it's also a relatable character piece with Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales and that's what's important I'm gonna remember this theatrical experience in Spider-Man across the spider-verse is awesome tacky I genuinely cannot wait for the third film all right so Spider-Man across the spider verse have you seen it or which one do you prefer do you prefer across the spider verse into the spider-verse whatever you think comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to say more ,2

that is just chef's kiss so go to factor75.com or click the link below and use code john's50 to get yourself 50 off your first Factor box also I do have fish for this review God ironically mention that one so the little mermaid is Disney's latest attempt at taking an animated classic and translating it to live action cherry on top let's take the lovable sidekick characters and make them look like what Metallica was singing about and Enter Sandman now funny post viewing experience this because when I got out of the movie I was like yeah that was cute it was surprisingly enjoyable but on my drive home when I was getting my thoughts together for my video the little nitpicks started they started to stack because there are a lot of them not gonna list them all in here but there are some worth mentioning but I'm gonna go ahead and list out what I liked about this movie because I'm gonna give you some sugar before this spice right what I liked Halle Bailey I thought she was great as Ariel she's sweet she's endearing has that Curiosity albeit that naive curiosity she's adorable and most importantly has an amazing voice but it's not just her Prince Eric Jonah Howard King I believe I'm pronouncing his name correctly I thought he was great as well more so in here than the anime because the animated movie is like hey that's the pretty guy you got a kiss in three days get at it this movie actually did a good job at fleshing Prince Eric out we talk about his hopes and dreams we find out a little more about him so I was glad to see that just for him as a character but that also really worked in me feeling their connection and that's that's the heart and soul of the movie this it's the nucleus it's the core of the this entire experience is the love between these two characters the animated Little Mermaid is a complete and total classic but you got to admit by the end you kind of had that feeling of like oh yeah they're infatuated in that shotgun wedding at the end of a weekend in Vegas kind of way it's still three days in this movie so it still happens fast but you still I saw the Sparks there I got the chemistry so when I say I have nitpicks for this movie and they're there I absolutely totally mean it but what I liked being them in their chemistry that's a huge part of the film so it's what brings the movie Up does outweigh what brings the movie down but what brings the movie Down is there it's actually a perfect embodiment of the phrase Death By A Thousand Cuts I feel like anybody who doesn't like this movie they they got there by a Thousand Cuts a thousand little nitpicks that just stacked up by the end and it was too much I get it I'll start with the more glaring things and work my way down to what Jeremy's just bitching I again not going to be everything but the most glaring thing is the fact that animation just has a style and a punch to it it has a stylistic way about it that I think the Little Mermaid just lends itself to not that this movie never looked animated there are some moments Under the Sea looked about as live action as that Mary Poppins penguin segment but you do see that in the Under the Sea musical segment man original Under the Sea segment that was it was like a cup of coffee in the morning that got you going under the sea segment here kind of gave me that feeling of that was that was pretty good karaoke example in this segment with Sebastian's listing off the marine life that plays instruments in the animation you see the marine life playing the instruments because why would you not in this live-action version when he's listing off the various marine life that plays instruments you see these big sea turtles walking it's just one long shot to see turtles walking because why would you not show sea turtles walking while listing off marine life that plays instruments makes sense it's like if the animated Under the Sea felt like a cup of coffee to get you going in the morning this live action Under the Sea kind of felt like taking a piss in the morning it's not waking me up it's just kind of it's routine we're just getting through it to get to the next thing and they seem like a little nitpick so maybe they are but to me they're details that change the world and the characters in the world like Ursula not hiding the fact that she says pathetic when she's singing about people who come to her for help pathetic and outwardly just saying pathetic magic changes both Ursula and Ariel Ursula because she's less crafty and Ariel's a bit more of an idiot because she wasn't like did you just call people pathetic wait are you calling me pathetic your weird little skeleton dungeon in the bottom of the sea was kind of a red flag but now I'm leaving bye that's why I talk about a few of these Thousand Cuts also in a world of Disney playing it safe Ursula doesn't turn mer people into the little the little seaweed monsters anymore they just die which I imagine for the original animation it was Disney being like we can't kill people we'll just turn them into little seaweed slaves on Ursula's bathroom floor because that's less dark but no it's far worse I don't even care what anyone says that scared the piss out of me when I was a kid actually I haven't even talked about Melissa McCarthy as Ursula Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was the thing I was most concerned about in here because I heard that I was like I feel like I know what I'm getting I'm getting Melissa McCarthy but she looks like Ursula but she's still Melissa McCarthy being Melissa McCarthy to her credit it 99 of the time she was legit playing Ursula she did not annoy me there was one scene I can think of in particular where I was like that was a Melissa McCarthy moment it was a moment that just existed to remind you that you're watching a family comedy Now Ursula's I've always found her funny but Sinister funny she does a pretty good job at that but this one scene I was like well that was just Melissa McCarthy funny funny it felt out of place it felt weird this wasn't in the original but we're gonna put it in here it's like but it feels shoehorned and feels weird it feels out of place like example the new musical segments in here that were not in the original they're made up for here but it feels like it was made up it feels like music that was made up over three decades later that doesn't really fit with the music in the movie there's a Synergy with the musical score The Little Mermaid musical segments it all works together it works in tandem to create some audible musical experience that feels consistent and okay we have these new songs that come in that don't feel consistent doesn't feel like the same world could have cut a couple of those out could have saved yourself you know 10 15 minutes of this 50 minute longer than the original run time it's 50 minutes longer did it need to be no to its credit it does use some of that time to flesh out Eric and you know like I said before you feel that Chemistry Between Eric and Ariel and that's part of that extra time was it 50 minutes of that not at all it didn't need to be 50 minutes longer it's about 50 minutes anyway if you take end credits out of the equation the fact that these end credits are longer than the old end credits probably 45. still fact remains this movie felt like it was at war with itself a few times just in terms of timing and pacing within a scene it's like they feel like they have to have the dialogue in this scene from The Animated original but it doesn't flow as well weird thing is at the very end I had heard this and I was like come on no yep there's no wedding at the end I know spoiler for the end but you're you know the story of Little Mermaid but you know at the end of Little Mermaid there's this wedding they have to stop the wedding it's not a wedding in here it's an engagement party and that just feels different granted the real clock you're up against is the sun you when the Sun goes down we lose but a wedding is such a stone wall that it works in tandem with that concept of the sun going down it really feels like zero hour it's like this when the day ends we lose we have to stop the wedding this this forever bond that Eric's going to enter that we just can't let him enter and that's the bummer for this video because I started the video off like oh yeah I liked Ariel and Eric and I really felt that chemistry I thought Halle Bailey was great and listen yeah also let me and nitpick about these things but my nitpicks went on for so much longer in the video some of them are bigger than others absolutely but I maintain the charm of what did work seems so small but it is the core of the film it's Ariel and Eric and if you can stick that Landing you can have a sweet enjoyable film for families that's just covered by a lot of annoyances but I'll say it's a good time no alcohol required at matinee price a huge bummer that the cook segment LEP was not in here what a great segment from the animated Little Mermaid and if you're really if you're looking at it in a world where Disney stories should have a lesson it's a great lesson a great example of perspective we see it as a kitchen we see it as Food Network Sebastian would see it as a House of Horrors they cut it out Disney Live Action you know they play it safer than the animations did maybe they felt like well we made all the marine life look real so now it looks like we're we're killing them we're killing their people but I mean it shows Scuttle in the movie eats a fish no one cares flounders like Scuttle you eat my people we're still friends I guess I don't care so you know it's weird a little inconsistent there all right so the Little Mermaid have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more ,1
"""https://youtu.be/VYjtSiF1DGs""",Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie,by coming at you with the feels on this one I was excited to watch this so let's talk about it you can tell whether so you get you get low energy Jeremy today a nice change of pace so still a Michael J fox movie is an autobiography about Michael J Fox as told by him that's what autobiography means so I guess that was a little redundant under the weather like I said and the world is full of biographies there are biographies out there very fascinating looks there are also some biographies out there I mean not all of them but sometimes you met with that feeling of yeah but who asked but in the case of Michael J fox I don't know about you but yes I I have asked for this I I want to know all the things yes we live in the age of information which means you can Chronicle it all yourself you can do your due diligence do the research find out all the behind the scenes things but it's nice to have it concisely Consolidated in one very digestible 90 minute film also these are his words about him from him it's not someone else talking about Michael J fox is there some information in here I was like I had heard that but hearing him actually be like yep that's how it was it just hits different and yeah this covers his child Hood to now and in his life as it is today and how he deals with his day-to-day and what I liked about the childhood element and in a situation like this usually it's when you talk about the childhood and how that feeds into the Ambitions the hopes the dreams and where the person is today right that's usually how it goes down but him talking about how he was a little kid who could never sit still he always had to be moving and that's just who he was he was always a very energetic person that feeds into him feeling like well I can't do those things now that hits hard and that's a huge element in this peak behind the curtain about how his body no longer supports his want to connect with people on a comedic level at covering his struggling actor phase I I find that stuff fascinating just business-wise there's a business Hollywood element in here that it's engaging to me the fact that he was selling office furniture to make ends meet the fact that Family Ties was supposed to be about the parents more and he was so charismatic they were like that's the guy and again with information I had already heard but it's great to hear him talk about it how he was filming Family Ties and Back to the Future at the same time getting about two hours of sleep a night maybe three if he's lucky Gotta Give It Up to the editing in here too there are scenes where he's talking about his past or Studio execs were talking about him and it'll show scenes from his movies illustrating the vibe of that moment I was so shocked at how well these scenes Blended in with setting the vibe of the situation I know actors are always supposed to draw from something real something they know but it's kind of wild it feels like Michael J fox was like all right I'm gonna take on roles that perfectly illustrate the vibe of of these prominent situations in my life just in case I ever make an autobiography about it editor needs some can't make bricks without clay I was baffled it was actually kind of amazing the editing in here it's a heartfelt look into his life his past is present and it's also one that you're thankful to be a part of you're thankful that he's extended that hand to us his fans the audience where he can be like hey here's the story I'm gonna answer all the questions I can here's my life hearing from Michael J fox himself talk about his career where he was how he got there his Parkinson's diagnosis and how he dealt with that it's special and human that kind of vulnerability and this look into his life doesn't just deal with the past like in his day to day every day the struggle that is for a lot of us on the fan side of things it was that day Michael J fox told the world that he has Parkinson's but for Michael J fox it's every day is a struggle you know he's an inspiring person it's as simple as that this is an interesting look into the life of an inspiring person and it's on Apple TV right now if my Tetris review taught me anything is that a lot of you out there you have Apple TV so there you go how to rate this one up how do you even write this one up I'll say this there was a hard copy out there it would be worth buying on Blu-Ray so there's that my voice cracked when I said blue rice it's time to go now I'm gonna give me some rest all right so still the Michael J fox story have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more right here to Seymour ,2
"""https://youtu.be/l3gG6PmD6bM""",Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,I missed the pre-embargo screening because I was out of town thank you for your patience but now I've seen Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3 and now we have work to do let's do it so Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3 is the third Guardians of the Galaxy film James Gunn's back to bring us this before he exits and becomes solely the DC guy for this third Adventure the Guardians are back because one of their own he's in trouble so if they go do a thing to save his life which leads him to another thing which really we're kind of on a Space Rabbit Hole here and we have a few characters to talk about here first of all Gamora I want to talk about Gamora because Gamora isn't really Gamora as we've known her this is a new Gamora from the Past who came to you know end game right now I was pleased with what they did with Gamora in here because you know how shows movies stories have the will they won't they Dynamic and then they do and now that Intrigue is lost and they know it so I thought their plan was all right kill off Gamora bringing a new Gamora from the pass and now we're back to will they won't they and that would have felt like they were taking steps back and they did not do that I like that I mean quill is trying to deal with it but this Gamora is she's a different Kimura she's actually she's kind of a dick and that was cool she fell felt like a daughter of Thanos you know she was more hardcore our beloved Gamora before she was you know she was a fighter she was nice probably why she went Splat and Rocket hands down the best part of the movie are you kidding me it's been said rocket is the heart of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3. I don't feel that's actually accurately representing the situation it's more like rockets movie is a better movie wrapped in this Guardians 3 movie which is by and large fine I think it's heartfelt it's painful it's sad I like that in here I'll get to why in a second other than me being grumpy old man energy you know that about me by now but hold on in a second also the high evolutionary as the villain of the film I liked him also I liked him until he starts just screaming at everybody and then I was like okay you went from being cool to being another villain who just screams at everybody take your place among the villains long forgotten who just scream I get that's probably the point of someone with a God complex yeah I'd probably get pissy and scream but I liked him when he was more collected and just kind of belittlingly dickish but largely the reason he works is because of rocket and the dynamic between the two I thought was fantastic and elements or character in this movie I felt was largely wasted was Adam Warlock maybe it was the six year wait I don't know maybe it was the fact we should have seen him before infinity War so we could have been in Infinity War you know it's possible I mean when I heard Will Poulter was Adam Warlock I was excited I was like he's a great actor let's see what he does but he could have been played by anybody and it's not even will poulter's fault the script just didn't give him enough to do I feel like this movie was like all right Guardians movie um you teased Adam Warlock in the in the post-credits scene of Guardians too we still haven't seen him we should probably have him in here fine let's make him a bounty hunter what do you say like yeah yeah he'll try to get the package the package being a someone fine and that's largely what he does he pounces onto the scene because he's here to get somebody he's here to kidnap someone and that's that that's that's his quest I wish I kind of would have been fine with if he had that higher way of speaking so at least when he's in a room talking people can be like whoa it's like you're the guys like you were created to be more oh you just did an Alan Watts monologue that's at least okay but that wasn't the case he kind of felt like if Superman and his powers went Splat with Pinocchio where it's like oh you're kind of a really powerful naive idiot who's not quite a real boy he never even says anything like I am less than human and far more than mad like nothing like that however Guardians 3 is a packed film so I kind of get it where it's like oh we also have to include Adam Warlock in a movie with rockets backstory you have the Guardians all working together and then the band splits up because there are a lot of them then you have the sub Guardians you know the ones hanging out on nowhere you have a lot of irons in this fire and you have to include Adam Warlock that's tough probably why you should have done an atom warlock Standalone film Maybe just maybe and I heard they were going to do a rocket Groot Standalone film and include Rocket's backstory with that that would have worked then you could have had Adam Warlock come into this movie and concentrate on his story and the high evolutionary you have the high evolutionary and then you have Adam Warlock who's like the Pinnacle of humanity and it's like they kind of address that and they're like yeah no we're going separate ways addressing it isn't hammering at home there's two different things they could have hammered at home they did not just keep Adam Warlock being the Bounty Hunter type he has a couple funny moments because MCU which largely does work for Guardians and as the Guardians of the Galaxy Adventure I thought the adventure was fine you get exactly what you pay ticket price for for Guardians of the Galaxy a space adventure with a crew of Misfits who largely yell at each other more in this movie than they feel they have before that did kind of get annoying for me multiple locations big CGI and then at a point they're like oh for higher morality we have to help the helpless people because we're the Guardians right problem is I feel like I've seen this before and not in that I've seen this two other times because this is Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3 kind of way but more on that this is another space adventure comedy in the MCU I feel like I've seen that a lot more and that's a bummer I do want to judge this movie based on it being Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3 and it does its part to be that whatever else is going on in the MCU not its problem we're the Guardians that's our thing the problem is in the MCU the Guardians used to be more unique they used to be the misfit band that was going on the comedic space adventure now comedic space adventure that that's just MCU not counting this movie two out of the previous three MCU films were comedic space adventure granted Ant-Man and the WASP quantumanian not outer space adventure more like Inner Space Adventure Point is a group of people end up on another world for an adventure comedy so I'm gonna go ahead and count it same energy as they say point is in a world where these space adventure comedies largely feel like what the MCU box is and we have the Marvels coming out so we got more coming this year I rather preferred it when the Guardians were the Misfits who were the space adventure comedy and the MCU was largely not bad the movie has its final Act CGI blast that I mean every MCU movie has that we know that's going to be the case that would it would almost be weird if Guardians of the Galaxy is a big space adventure was like all right and no big CGI third act it just kind of it's done now the emotional things are what ended it that said it does have some cool visuals including this one corridor our fight that's you know how it is one of those One-Shot green screen fights among a bunch of people where the Guardians are fighting a bunch of monsters that look like they're from the Doom video game it's pretty great I love that scene that was badass did it need to be in there absolutely not is the movie too long absolutely but of the things that you could cut out of here that is one I'd like to stay what is it about comic book movies is this they're like all right two and a half hours minimum not that a long run time is innately bad but I couldn't help but walk out of this movie and be like yeah you could have trimmed some Corners you could have cut that one down in the end Guardians of the Galaxy volume 3 it's a fine space adventure it's a nice end to the Guardians movies that I've heard it's the last Guardians movie but ironically and even sadly Guardians 3 feels more like a familiar MCU formula film rather than the unique Vision that started Guardians of the Galaxy in the first place get some beers get some friends probably be a good time if you're drunk yeah now it's a party but what I liked most about it wasn't the fun Guardians of the guy Galaxy Adventure it was actually the Rocket Raccoon tragedy real question is this the first MCU film to drop the F-bomb because there is an F-bomb in here I can't think of any other one in any other MCU movie if so well history has been made in a way all right so Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3 have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to say more ,0
"""https://youtu.be/LutvnOXNoOc""",Star Trek: Picard,all right so Star Trek Picard season three it's good to the Odyssey of Star Trek Picard has been a wild one I saw season one I I felt I was nice to season one in season two I started watching it after the whole thing had come out so I already heard the chatter that people didn't like it that chatter mixed with what I was seeing in season two I got to about episode two and I was like I'm good gotta admit though I did laugh when Picard looks right at Q and he was like I'm too old for your [ __ ] so I wasn't interested in season three and then people started saying it was good I'm talking silver-haired old school Star Trek fans were saying no it's really good so I binged it yeah it's really good also this is gonna be generally speaking a spoiler-free video I know some people might want me to delve deeper into the goings-on of season three of Picard but that's a balancing act right there but there are reveals moments plot lines unfolding in which I think it'll serve you best watching it unfold not knowing it's coming rather than me telling you it's coming and it's just the impact's not as great I am going to talk about Beverly crusher's son and that Maury Povich kind of way who is the father I am going to talk about the lineage because I feel like that's important to talk about when talking about this season pretty sure you find out in episode two so it's fine now the big question is do you need to watch seasons one and two to understand what's going on in season three no you don't they make some references to season one don't know if they may need to season two but I guess that speaks to the fact that you don't need to watch season two because I didn't feel like I was missing anything but yeah essentially Picard's season three could have been called Star Trek Picard no seriously we mean it this time the character Rafi is the only character in season three that I recognize from season one at I was like everyone else is just gone so if you haven't seen it you might be like who who is this person who's this character why do I care but pretty soon it's going to be this character is hanging out with Wharf so if you don't know who she is at least she's hanging out with Worf you know Wharf you know what really hit me after episode one when the end credit song was the musical score to Star Trek first Contact which is what one of the most beautiful Star Trek songs ever made that's when I was like okay in terms of song Choice it's a pretty good pull right there it's they seem to know what the fans want I'll keep going it's amazing what music can do and I just fell in love with that theme in the movie theaters when I saw first Contact it was incredible and I have to talk about Jack Crusher because family is a huge part of the theme of Picard's season three feels weird to even call it Picard season three I might actually call it Picard yes we mean it we're serious this time not just the theme of The Blood Ties of family but also the family that you adopt throughout life I mean the Enterprise the crew is a family they talk about that in hearing you absolutely feel it there's this one scene where seven of nines reminiscing about Voyager and again with the importance of musical cues you hear the voyager's theme start to swell in the background almost like this is yeah business hitting there's another thing I liked about this this isn't just a love letter to Next Generation I mean it is but it's a love letter to that chapter in the federation's Life in that time frame you had Next Generation Deep Space Nine and Voyager and you get ties to all of it at some point it actually felt very MKX like if I look back at Mortal Kombat X I feel Mortal Kombat X did a really good job at having the Legacy characters age and then they bring their offspring their sons and daughters and their friends into it it all mixed really well that's what this feels like you know Jordi laforge has a daughter she's at the helm Picard and Beverly Crusher have their son jack yeah oopsie Daisy I'm editing this video and I realize I forgot to tell you jack is the love child of Beverly Crusher and Jean Louis Picard okay moving on I know this may finish me shut up Wesley and there's Intrigue there's mystery with Jack you're like why is he why does he seem to see the upside down from stranger things what's going on with him I mean yeah granted it still deals with the whole uh Luke you never really wanted a son he didn't think you'd be good at it I'm like so Inner Light still didn't happen and okay whatever but if you're going to ignore inner light at least give me a compelling character dynamic between these two and I felt they did now bringing the characters back I was worried about wharfs probably another reason I was like I don't need to watch this because in the trailer and also in the show warp says something about it you should know that I now prefer pacifism to a combat we're all gonna die I was like of course they took the proud warrior Klingon and they're making him a pacifist what there's nothing more 2023 than that but it's not really like that the first thing he does is kill a group of scumbags decapitates this one dude I was like oh okay so you're still proud Klingon Warrior Wharf you just you know you meditate and find your center before or after doing that I can get behind that that's awesome we do have some newcomers as well the villains played by Amanda Plummer she plays vatic Amanda Plummer is such an interesting choice because I'm used to her playing quirky characters and she absolutely doesn't hear her on the edge of Madness is absolutely in line with the character and I dug what her character was tied into damn spoiler free I I like that that was a good pull and I got to give props to Brent Spiner my recent binge of Star Trek the Next Generation I'd watch all the special features at the end of each of the seasons and they all just give so much love to Brent Spiner like Patrick Stewart's like he is so talented and you really do see it you look at that episode um Fistful of dadas is what it's called where he the the Holodeck starts going awry so data is playing like Brent Spiner anyway is playing all the characters you just see the range there prefacing that leading into the point here which is when he's data and he would snap to lore and he'd snapped a b forward he has to play all these characters it reminded me of Willem Dafoe and Spider-Man when he's Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin talking to himself in the mirror and that's so great to see because you know you grow up loving this crew of characters and when they're all coming back you hope they haven't lost it you just hope it feels as seamless as it feels in your head it all worked and they all still got it they feel like they're characters you know you were never like that doesn't feel like Jordy laforge because it totally feels like Jordy laforge Riker feels like Riker War feels like Wharf and data has now come closer than ever to his actual ultimate goal his goal isn't just to get emotion it's like he got emotion everyone was like that's good enough there's a respect to the characters shown here in a world where Life Is Life and sometimes friends drift apart you get the feeling yeah this crew hasn't seen each other in a very long time but they come back together well because time is relative it could be a million years but they are still that family I will say there were a couple moments where I was like that is Nostalgia bait you know like Moriarty saw him in the trailer and I was like oh [ __ ] Moriarty's coming back so we didn't that little simulation he was in didn't get destroyed when Enterprise D went down in Star Trek generations Betty's pretty pissed about that turns out it's not really that he's just in it for one scene and it's a simulation of him it's not the same program per se and so then the scene's over and it ends and he's gone I was kind of bummed out about that he was one of the memorable characters one of the ones that calling him a villain doesn't really do the complexity of the character Justice he's incredible and he's my favorite Moriarty just ever it was good to see him but that Nostalgia wasn't as organic as the rest of it in the show also the show is really dark at a point I was like does the Federation have a religious thing against lights what's with the lighting the bridge is super dank there's at the end of the show someone's getting their debriefing they're getting a talking toe really dark it's just like this one three watt bulb lighting both of them I was like why though I get it looks all cinematic and dramatic but at the end when the crew gets together and they're making their big like hey it's we do this or the universe dies is a bit hyperbolic Galaxy though like that bridge is lit up just fine so I mean you could say it's allegory like yeah it was all depressing when they weren't together and now light and life that couldn't help but be like yeah but while we're all wallowing in depression and and the crew's not back together yet can we have a little bit more light just a little I almost forgot to talk about grumpy dick Captain he was great I loved him I'm gonna give him his proper deal and call him Todd stashwick that is the actor's name he is not just Dollar Store Negan but he definitely felt like if Negan joined Starfleet bring that energy not that he's bludgeoning people to death with bats or anything but you know when they turn Negan good were you still watching at that point no well I'll fill you in they turn Negan good right but he still had that sarcastic energy this dude is that as a captain he was just such a grumpy chromogenous dick I couldn't help but be entertained when he was on screen it's one of those characters you don't necessarily want to go out of your way to hang out with him but say you're hanging out with friends and this dude showed up you'd be like oh man it's the grumpy deck and then by the end of the night you'd be like but he did make me laugh he was fantastic a total standout there's a moment dealing with him in seven of nine where I was like I the move shut up I'm not crying you're crying track will bring on the man tears and they're supposed to and you know when at a point when the ax drops and it's like okay these are the stakes and we really gotta it's up to us crew I thought that was actually really clever just in terms of the tech of the Universe I really dug that and in the last couple episodes I didn't know who was going to live or die I like that because it's like yeah you bring the crew back they're all you know aging we'll say this is the last season of Star Trek Picard I feel like this is probably the last time these actors are going to reprise these roles so anything can happen I like not knowing who's gonna live or who's gonna die and the stakes they were the [ __ ] stakes and in the end this is the final mission for the Next Generation crew that they deserve I mean they essentially had that at one point with all good things it's an incredible series finale one of the best ever though the next Generation movies were when it was great it was great with first Contact ended with a whimper in Star Trek Nemesis and that's what we were left with that was the last mission with this crew they just deserved better this is that better and I'm glad I watched it and I'm glad it looks like the creative team listened to fans and they're like okay they're not digging seasons one and two oh they want the crew to get back together and have that whole next gen all right I guess we'll give them that I mean in terms of the Next Generation crew coming back together the band is getting back together what do you want to see no you don't get that you don't get to see will Reicher smash on ryzer for 10 solid episodes but you get the next best thing your beloved crew of senior citizens coming together going against Starfleet protocol to save the Galaxy yeah you get that and it's awesome all right so Star Trek Picard season three have

"""https://youtu.be/9akhuvxEpXw""",Chevalier,love me a good historical biopic in this case a biopic about someone we all probably should have learned about in history class but we did not so now we get to see this person's life through a keyhole let's do it so Chevalier is a biopic about the life of Joseph Balon musical Maestro also expert sword fighter also Marksman you imagine something that the human body or imagination can do and he was just good at it a superpower he just had a superpower that was being great at things I was glad they touched on him being a swordsman it's not just like oh he's great at violin there was more to it but more to it in real life than the movie actually showed so there is that now this takes place Circa France 1700s right before the French Revolution out the gate giving credit to Kelvin Harrison Jr as Joseph Balon Chevalier himself I thought it was fantastic in the role and he generally carries the film yes he does have some great supporting actors working with him Samara weaving being one of them now this movie surprised me at being about an hour and 45 minute run time I'm not used to that for historical musical biopics usually I'm I'm used to the Amadeus that's a quantifiable run time Amadeus it's usually like how long is this movie uh Amadeus [ __ ] all right let me piss first one second right so an hour 45 it works both for this film and against in that same way that your weaknesses are your strengths just in certain situations and vice versa case in point hour 45 minutes is generally speaking a pretty tight run time you're engaged for most of it that said this movie could have and should have been so much more I mean keeping it vague he has this friend in the movie and then he and his friends they seem pretty close and they have a falling out and he says something like I defended you when people were besmirching your name I wanted to be like anyone in this theater who saw that happen could you raise your hand all right so it's not just me that legitimately did not happen on screen it's a classic case for the movie telling you something happened without showing you that thing happened which means it doesn't really stick The Landing emotionally speaking I wouldn't doubt it it would not surprise me if I found out later there's some three hour cut of this film out there somewhere I feel like this film's gonna run into problems with audiences with one of two scenarios you're in one of two camps one you are skilled and versed you're a scholar into the life of Joseph Balon in which case you're gonna watch this film and be like well that was a Bare Bones could have should have been more version of that person's life or two and this is where I ran into it I walked out of the movie being like that was perfectly enjoyable it was a perfectly enjoyable biopic absolutely then I was interested enough to look into the life further which is really what a biopic should leave you with but man this is a rare case of the real life story being far more interesting than this movie was yeah aside from violin riding dancing swimming skating fencing the movie touches on two of those things including violin and some of it was traded out for the sake of entertainment but also not historically accurate for example the way this movie starts out is is him having a dueling violin Showdown with Mozart for the film's entertainment purposes it was absolutely entertaining and pretty awesome and I know why they did it because people have taken to calling Joseph balloon black Mozart which severely undercuts him and his skills and all that he did so it's like all right have him whip Mozart's ass there you go but historically not only do these two cross paths but they lived under the same roof at a point in fact historians have taken some of Mozart's music and lined it up with Joseph balloons and they're like I'm pretty sure Mozart stole that that to me is more interesting but yeah you can have him just dueling violins at the beginning and sure also the dude fought in war that's a huge part of his life but we just kind of get that in the text at the end I hope this movie is successful in that gauging audience interest kind of way so we can hopefully get that HBO miniseries that this life absolutely lends itself to this was an interesting glimpse into a very fascinating life but it feels like that a glimpse if you can imagine viewing a beautiful landscape through a keyhole that's what this movie feels like but for a casual viewing experience it's perfectly enjoyable I'm gonna say it's a good time no alcohol required caveat at matinee price all right so Chevalier have you seen it what did you think about it what's your favorite historical biopic whatever it is whatever you think comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more ,1
"""https://youtu.be/4WrxHr02KzE""",Renfield,you see this is why failure is more important than success because if that mummy reboot had succeeded it launched the dark universe as it was intended to we probably never would have gotten to see what would happen if Nick Cage and all Nick cages went Splat with Count Dracula so renfield's directed by Chris McKay Stars Nicholas Holt as Renfield who is Dracula's familiar Nicholas Cage plays Count Dracula and this movie is a bloody dark comedy slash allegory about getting out of toxic relationships with narcissists okay obviously we're dealing with a little bit more than just narcissism here and half of this movie is exactly what the trailer pitches and promises you which is exactly what works Renfield and Dracula that whole dynamic it's pretty awesome when I heard Nicholas Cage was playing Dracula in this movie before I saw the trailer I was like that that's one of those calls either someone knows exactly what they're doing or they are so far off the mark happy to say it absolutely works it works for the tone of that I mean it wouldn't work for any movie if you plopped Nicholas Cage Dracula in Bram Stoker's Dracula no but for a hyper violent bloody dark comedy in which Nicholas Cage can just be unhinged and be that which we know to be Nick Cage also Dracula version of him it totally works as we all know there's only only one Nick Cage and so this is the only person who can ever play Dracula like this and actually have it work the big bummer is the unbearable weight of massive Talent came out last year if it had come out after this movie came out they'd have a lot more to play with Nicholas Holtz also great in this movie I feel like in these past years we've seen Nicholas Holtz either get better at his comedic timing or get roles in which he can better articulate it and show it on screen it also has a bit of a superhero angle in there he eats bugs that's how he gets the powers that Dracula's giving him in which case he can completely annihilate people by annihilate them I mean punch their heads off rip their arms off I was baffled every now and then when ass and blood just shoots everywhere and it's like a couple drops just hit the person that did it or the person that's two feet from the body that exploded and it was like the CGI blood has to become real blood on the people for the next shot you know like I knew he forgot something there is something amazing about blood and gore that goes together with comedy so well I won't say like peanut butter and jelly it's not that commonplace but definitely peanut butter and honey it's that delicious the action sequences they were great exciting bloody fun absolutely and I feel like the allegory the relationship between Renfield and Dracula and Renfield trying to break away but Dracula being a narcissist that's what's gonna hit people if they get hooked with this movie that's the hook it's actually really well done with characters that are perfect allegory for that that said that's half the movie there's another movie wrapped into this movie that makes you go like where did this come from no one no one cares and it has to deal with aquafina's character playing this cop in this Precinct they're corrupt cops and she's trying to take down this mob family I'm telling you it feels like someone was like yeah I'm working on a script right now for a movie I call Renfield we're trying to get Nick Cage to play Dracula don't worry it should work it'll be a violent dark comedy slash allegory about toxic relationships I'll have superhero elements you know Renfield will eat bugs he'll get powers and totally obliterate Baddies I only have 45 minutes of script written now so don't quite know what to do with it that sounds amazing to me let me know how that goes I'm working on a script right now too we're trying to get Aquafina for the role she's this nice cop in a Precinct full of crooked cops she doesn't know who to trust her father was killed on duty by these Mobsters so she's trying to take down these Mobsters who deal Coke don't have a title yet but I call it Coke decks you know dick d-i-c-s as in detectives in charge and it's a working title anyway but I only have 45 minutes of the script written so I don't know what to do with it either wait a minute I have 45 minutes I have 45 minutes by the power of math we combine these two into one 90-minute film boom it feels like that is exactly what happened this movie feels like two movies and one of these movies is really compelling the other one probably could have been as its own movie in a Renfield Dracula movie just feels out of place granted in any vampire or Dracula movie you're gonna have people that aren't Supernatural and they're just kind of peering into this situation as to what's going on I get Renfield getting a friend absolutely but to bring the precinct and these Mobsters into the story in that Renfield kind of feels like the Warcraft movie for me where I'm like half of that movie was great the other half I did not care about only instead of the great half being the Orcs it's the Dracula Renfield element in the end when this movie was a bloody good time it was when it was funny the audience was laughing Nicolas Cage and Nicholas halt have an amazing Dynamic and if anyone buys a ticket just to see Nick Cage play Dracula the way he does I would not fault them the movie started out amazing but as it kept going felt the momentum just got compromised with this other movie within the movie that I just didn't care about I feel like this movie be a better time with a bit of the sacrament yes now it's a party all right so Renfield have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought comment below let me know and as always if you like

"""https://youtu.be/D0-DLIFhktg""",The Super Mario Bros. Movie,three decades after that classic early 90s trash fire monstrosity Nintendo was like okay we will give a mulligan another Mario Brothers movie We're allowing it here's hoping for a Legend of Zelda movie and Metroid also but here we go Mario so the Super Mario Brothers movie is an adaptation of the Super Mario Brothers game for the big screen I feel like that's all the setup you need right there it's an animated feature by illumination entertainment the plot is very much the plot of a Super Mario game Mario and Luigi go down a drain go to this magical world Bowser's causing problems he needs to be stopped want to touch on the voice acting here also because that's where the apprehension was like oh Chris Pratt it's Mario's hmm no one seemed Blown Away by Chris Pratt's Mario iteration in the trailer but he really works in this movie in fact most anyone in this movie is pretty well cast they do a good job in this movie in a very clever way addressing Mario sounds like this and that's totally cool but it's not just Mario Charlie day is Luigi is next level perfect Anya Taylor Joy is peach Keegan Michael key is Toad Seth Rogen is Donkey Kong going on and on here but the point is when you're watching the movie and you're watching the voices play out in front of you you can't help but think is there anyone else I would cast who would be better in these roles no not for my money I can't think of anyone Jack Black as Bowser also great there's actually some humorous moments with Bowser where he's just pining over Peach and you gotta think well yeah he probably does do that in his off time it's part of the humor of the movie because this is an animated feature for children there is one small role in the movie A support character that I didn't feel the voice fit as well I don't know if people know this character's in the movie but I could have gone for the character sounding older and crankier and the animation is great this movie is kind of extraordinary actually the metric for that I don't know if it's even accurate but it's water effects water particles when anyone's in water for some odd reason I look at that I'm like okay that's how good the animation is in Super Mario Brothers movie it's actually pretty incredible Easter eggs and references oh yeah they're all in here and they start out pretty early too the thing that makes it different for this movie is there are a lot of movies out there that just rely on Easter eggs and references this never felt like member berries it just it felt like a celebration it felt fun it would have felt weird if they didn't have them so I enjoyed them when I saw them I had fun when they caught my eye my fellow Super Mario Brothers Super Show fans you'll know it you'll hear it and Brian Tyler's musical score for this film I felt was a great way to take classic Mario tunes and adapt them for live actuals not live action it's animated but you know what I mean adapt it for the big screen change it up a little bit to fit the action sequence that's going down as it's going down but still maintain the core of the theme that you're playing off of I thought it was really well done and what a project you know that must have been a lot of fun being like I have these classic tunes that I get to tweak with and adapt to the big screen I kind of envy him for that as for what bothered me in this movie I know you don't want things to bother you it's a Mario movie but there are always things I felt this movie cut short that which makes a Mario game a Mario game which is the platforming the action platforming example there's a scene where they're like okay we're at Point a we gotta get to point B here we go then it cuts back to them they're like okay we've arrived at point B well my thought was I I'm sure there's a whole journey to getting here and that's really the spirit of a Super Mario Brothers game there seemed to be a movie that was more concerned about the destination than the journey and I feel like a Mario game is more concerned with the journey than the destination not that the movie doesn't have action sequences the last act has all of that it's actually kind of awesome it's a lot it's fun it's within the context and lore of the Super Mario Brothers games and the power-ups that be now finishing off my I know Less Fun negative observations I got to address something the movie did that I felt did hurt it and that is separating Mario and Luigi they do kind of a script flipping here where Luigi's the one that gets captured by Bowser so it's Mario Peach and Toad that are on the adventure Peach not getting captured and going on the adventure totally fine on more than a couple of occasions she has been in on the action by not getting kidnapped whatever but it was weird that they felt someone still needed to get kidnapped so we're gonna kidnap Luigi they use that as the reason Mario goes on this adventure but I don't think he needed it there's enough Threat Level there it's like Bowser is going to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom maybe Mario or Luigi would be like oh we just want to get home but one of them could talk to the other one and be like we should help we need help because that's what Heroes do and then they'll be like all right yeah let's let's help this world out that sounds like a good idea because we're good guys I'd be totally fine with that all this is to say I thought it was a mistake separating Mario and Luigi because Chris Pratt and Charlie Day are amazing together the Mario and Luigi Dynamic the Brotherly Love dynamic between these two was actually kind of incredible and the first 20 minutes or so of setup is with them and then you separate them yeah I had that feeling of oh well Mario and Luigi need to you know he needs to save his brother so the duo can get back together but what superseded that feeling what overrode that was the feeling of yeah the movie is a lot less now because they're separated it would have been so much better to keep them on screen together I know Mario's had his solo Adventures before without Luigi but in terms of this movie and the setup for this film the two were just too good together to separate look in the end you're gonna hear this word where people talk about the Super Mario Brothers movie you're gonna hear it's a cute movie because it's true it is a cute movie it's actually a really tough thing adapting a Super Mario Brothers movie because Super Mario fandom spans about well it's nearly four decades now who do you aim the movie towards this is a family film it's a film for children absolutely it hit its Mark in some spots had its flaws in other spots funny it's a 90 minute run time usually I feel like that's a perfect run time for a family animated film but if they kick that up to an hour 45 it felt like we could have gotten one or two more action platforming sequences that would have felt a little more like a Mario Brothers game it's a fun family time at the movies it's not as amazing as you probably wanted to be but also on the other hand it doesn't suck some of the flaws aside I still had a fun time in this one no alcohol required or mushrooms you know whatever substance is in the Mushroom Kingdom these days or so the Super Mario Brothers movie have you seen it what did you think about it what's your favorite Super Mario Brothers game that's a good question whatever you think comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more Metroid is Ellen Ripley in an

"""https://youtu.be/PGx176vUvBU""",Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,for the past two decades I cannot see the title Dungeons and Dragons or hear it and not think of that classic audio comedy Dungeons and Dragons Satan's game and I figured I'd start this video out by blowing your mind taking you back to the Napster days but we got a new DND movie to talk about so let's do it so Dungeons and Dragons honor among Thieves is a new fantasy comedy based off of the popular role-playing game and I had no care for a new dungeons of dragons movie Zero [ __ ] given I I don't even think I think I might have seen one trailer back in the day but no more what can I say I was there over two decades ago when the previous d d movie came out all my friends and I were all pumped and well that well it happened the way it happens and I guess that just changed me which is completely unfair new creative team this movie's not even linked to that movie it's unfair to be like that movie from a couple decades sucked so I'm not gonna look forward to this movie what can I say it's just just how it was and to my surprise this movie was a shh fuckingly enjoyable time first of all you have Chris Pine leading this film for what this movie is that is perfect it's perfect casting for a league because Chris Pine comes across as naturally charmingly funny it doesn't ever feel like he's trying there are people who say funny things and there are people who say things funny for example Hugh Grant in this movie it does feel like Hugh Grant is scripted to say funny things you can almost see the director be like okay now do a quirky yeah that's the energy we're going for perfect he's saying funny things because he needs to in this fantasy Adventure comedy Chris Pine just comes across as saying things funny he's just naturally being Chris Pine and is working the script can be bad guy we are taking her to the castle good guy wait where are you taking her with most people it'd be like we're taking her to the castle where are you taking her with Chris Pine is like we're taking her to the castle oh good wait where are you taking her for this movie and what the vibe the movie was going for Chris Pine absolutely worked that is Mary band of Misfits work too it's good of amusing to me that we're we're done with the age of the of the super strong like yes the warrior the Paladin is absolutely the lead good guy not Chris Pine's The Bard you have a mage Barbarian you do have a paladin that comes in for a bit they do come across as a group of we shouldn't be the last best hope but we are so we're just gonna do our thing and in fact it's not to do the thing Chris Pine's trying to save his daughter which is a fun flip on the whole Save The Princess and the castle thing and when thinking about it maybe I'm just looking for excuses I I don't know but in full transparency it's absolutely possible but the banter that they have in this movie and making this a fun a friendly banter comedy I guess it's the term not a real genre but I'ma say it that way it does have that Vibe of the kind of banter friends would have when they're around a table playing DND granted it didn't need to be that way for that reason right when the Warhammer series comes out I want the dark gritty lore-based world that I like about Warhammer because friends play it around a table I don't need a banter comedy or someone's like all right can you hit him I can but uh all right I think I have line of sight it's on his shoulder this this shot's gonna kill him because it hits his shoulder what no you don't have line of sight yeah I do here check it all right well it's not really a line of size totally line of sight I can hit his shoulder no you can't well I can hit his toe that counts too I don't need dialogue like that though it is a thing it's the kind of dialogue and banter that happens when people play Warhammer there's even this one scene where someone's listing off everything they need to do to get across this problem it just sounds like a DM listing off the overly complicated rules that the players need to do to to solve this problem I couldn't help but see that scene see the banter and feel like oh that's why they went for this Vibe they like the vibe of friends around a table playing d d though it they're not around the table they're in the world which is how it's supposed to feel when you play DND you have an active imagination so there is that that might act as a double-edged sword though they're people who watch this movie I know they're DND fans are like yeah that's it was actually pretty cool because that's how it feels there might be other folks out there who will be like it's D and D I love d d I was hoping for the next Lord of the Rings come on this is not that it's not the next Lord of the Rings though to be fair I don't think audiences anywhere ever thought it could be or would be the CGI in this movie is absolutely ass which is another funny thing it's like hey it's an action comedy with [ __ ] CGI sounds like we're talking about recent MCU I usually give the MCU scrutiny for that but all things not being equal I just I don't as much for this movie because Dungeons and Dragons honor among Thieves isn't the biggest cinematic property in the history of movies backed by the biggest Studio feels like an underdog so it's like all right you have [ __ ] CGI I get it you didn't have an unlimited budget whatever kind of like in high school but I got a B on a test the teacher was like Jeremy you got a B so good to see that you actually studied for this test it looks like that studying is paying off good job but if the straight A student got a B you'd be like is everything okay is a do you need to talk to a counselor and this movie is a bit too long could have shaped 15 minutes easy but in the end Dungeons and Dragons honor among Thieves it surprised me it's a fun fantasy Adventure comedy with endearing characters actually had a pretty solid Heist segment in here too that I felt was the strongest part of the entire thing actually second to the movie's core and to its core it does have a heartfelt family dynamic in here I really appreciate it I rarely bring up ratings but it's rated PG-13 I bring it up because it's in that Revenge of the Sith kind of way where it's like well it's not the hardest PG-13 I've ever seen that is to say if you and your family you're looking for a nice time out at the movies this movie comes out at the end of the month I feel like this is a good one it was a fun time no alcohol required all right so Dungeons and Dragons honor among Thieves have you seen it what did you think about it or do you play D and D what's your class do you cast magic Missile and do you attack the darkness

"""https://youtu.be/MTflfuTKwEE""",Shazam! Fury Of The Gods,yeah a new case of sequelitis you hate to see it but it happens I really liked and loved by me Shazam Billy Batson and his siblings The Rock and the powers of Shazam otherwise known as powers of gods they're out there saving people but not so gracefully doing so a lot of collateral damage but now these goddesses known as the daughters of Kronos they've shown up they don't like humans too much so all right they're gonna cause problems new movie now what I liked about this movie I got to give a special shout out to Jack Dylan Grazer I felt he was the emotional center of the entire film he's always been a talented kid this movie is a testament to that I felt he really brought it but it is also a testament to the fact that the emotional center of a movie like this is when they're not superheroes they're just normal kids and that also feeds into what I appreciate about Asher Angel playing Billy Batson in this film because in the previous film the contrast between Billy Batson Asher Angel and how Zachary Levi acted it was too vast they didn't feel like the same person that Gap that contrast it's still there but you can tell Asher Angel is trying his best to act like Zach Levi more in this film than he did in the previous film it's like they listened to the fan feedback they proceed accordingly I appreciate that weird thing is Billy Batson is largely absent in this film he's in it but not as much as you'd think not as much as the previous film most of the time when you see the character he's Shazam he's Zachary Levi he's the adult superhero version there are even scenes where he and his Shazam fam they're all hanging out in their Shazam cave and they're they're in their superhero Shazam well I guess it's not outfits they're in their adult superhero forms but they're just planning and hanging out no reason to be and I felt that did cost the movie Something the emotional center point of the characters is best seen when their kids you know when they're in their youthful form and they're dealing with their problems when they're in their Shazam form for most of the movie it loses a bit of that contrast it feels less like their kids who get to become superheroes and more like their god-like superheroes who sometimes become kids and that was actually the positive part of the review because the rest of the movie was just it was generic superhero stuff you don't really have cool or relatable villains in this movie granted you could make the villains people don't really know or care about you can make them cool in the movie but they just didn't generally love Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu but they came across as generic 2004 comic book movie villains dropped in 2023. from there the rest of the movie is bringing back characters they killed off in the previous movie that they want to bring back for this movie also it's a flowing ebb of have their powers they don't because they have to Nerf the Shazam fam otherwise the baddies to be taken out pretty quickly that's what I mean when I say sequelitis not like this movie was planned from the first one if it was don't tell me it was let me blissfully believe that the mess of a sequel came about because of the success of the first movie and it wasn't planned I used the word generic because it's the only word to describe my general feeling that this movie left me with generic villain summon a whole horde of generic CGI monsters for the last act and I didn't care didn't care about the CGI monsters didn't care about the villains that summoned them and there are some emotional moments in this movie even near the end I did appreciate they were there I was just bored by the time I saw them now I do appreciate the fact this movie doesn't rely on the general dceu which is now non-existent but it doesn't rely on the universe to pitch and sell the movie it operates how I feel a comic book movie should operate operate within your own contained story know that as part of a larger universe as a whole have a couple Easter eggs in there that reminds the odd audience that is part of that but they don't have to watch every TV show movie it doesn't feel like homework I did appreciate Shazam for that granted there is that overall feeling when a couple of tie-ins are referenced and are shown you're like what's the point luckily these moments don't plague the film too badly but you can't help but notice you can't help but think about it you can't help but when you see these moments think to yourself what is the point look in the end Shazam Fury of the Gods as someone who loved the first shazam movie I was really disappointed with this sequel as a movie that deals largely with magic it was surprisingly devoid of it it almost feels like they didn't know what made the first shazam movie special and click with audiences who liked it so they were just grasping at straws for the sequel you know what's funny is I don't even hate this movie it sounds like I do but I don't it's I kind of nothing I'm not gonna remember not in T minus one day yep already forgot all right so Shazam Fury of the gods have you seen it what did you think about it whatever

"""https://youtu.be/C9EUTpXiWkE""",John Wick: Chapter 4,foreign I love these movies so John Wick chapter 4 is the fourth chapter in what we call the absolutely amazing John Wick series after the events of chapters two and three the table it's pretty much the John Wick Illuminati they're the the Council of this underworld of Assassins they want John Wick dealt with Phil Skarsgard plays the one leading that charge and now John Wick who for two movies now has heard that beep beep beep sound in his ear because he's been at minimal HP he's licked his wounds he's healed up now he's back to full HP and now yes he's here to play you want to hear about the action right well we gotta talk about the characters first first of all I mean I'm convinced Keanu is the only one who could keep this franchise going this long because he's he's so Keanu on screen in a way that no one else could be yeah I would be shocked if I learned he had more than 10 lines in this entire film but I kind of see his character kind of see John Wick as the penitent one in silence and blasphemy as a game which I love where is Blasphemous 2 information I just want a trailer come on dependent one he never talks but he is the vessel taking the audience through this Odyssey through this world of rules and lore and it's kind of what John Wick is there are supporting characters in this film which Hammer home the dramatic moments John Wick's language that he communicates with the audience is one of action but it's done so well it's a communication that still does hit it's it's a language all its own that they absolutely nail in John Wick but the support characters in this film I thought were great Bill Skarsgard I will use the word magnificent because that's that's the kind of character he is he's a magnificent character absolute douche total prick in that John Wick kind of world it's a world of fashion and Flair big Cathedrals huge art galleries amazing suits and that's why we watch it and he's the guy who wears the most expensive [ __ ] but doesn't have one tenth the class I thought he was great Donnie and his character I felt lend some complexity but also amazing physicality because it's Donnie and in a John Wick movie of course you're going to use his physicality different characters giving different fight Styles the movie never feels redundant and that's saying something 2 hour 45 minute action film a two hour 45 minute action film that's the fourth film in the franchise also Donnie Yen plays a blind badass like in Rogue one this is kind of funny to me and it totally works it's like oh blind Donnie Yen so he's gonna [ __ ] everyone up everyone knows that they're about to shed their mortal coil great as long as I know it totally works for former Jedi and John Wick characters that's kind of that's the realm John Wick's playing with here ever since the first John Wick when we got to the Continental in the first John Wick I was like there is something comic book flavor in here and I love it let me just slip into it like a warm bath and four continues to play with it amazingly also Shamir Anderson's character true wild card also he has the dog he's the dog element he's the one with the attack dog that assists him because it's not a John Wick film without a dog as for the action sequences incredible I think is putting it mildly because at this point you feel like okay it's the fourth John Wick movie I've seen it all before but not like this the John Wick movies do a good job at escalation you know yeah in John Wick movies before you've seen shootouts you've seen hand-to-hand combat you've seen hand weapon combat you've seen human body versus automobile combat but not like you've seen it in John Wick chapter four it just does an incredible job at making you feel like this is the first time you've experienced a John Wick film usually that's something that the first sequel has to deal with like how do we make two not feel like one this is the fourth chapter the fourth installment still feels new there was actually an action sequence in here I was like I said to the dude to the left of me I know him don't worry it wasn't weird not like I was like Hey dude I never met before I went dude this feels like a video game and I meant that in the best way possible and he replied it feels like Hotline Miami my response was can I use the video thank you Aaron I appreciate it this is the perfect way to describe it I was watching it I was like this is Hotline Miami and I know what you're thinking we've seen action sequences I feel like Hotline Miami not like this I never felt the two hour 45 minute run time at no point did I feel like I was watching a movie that was almost three hours it always had great momentum it was always being pushed forward and they used all of that time to introduce characters that are actually interesting characters you wouldn't mind seeing in the future possibly in spin-offs I know we're already getting a spin-off about the Continental I would not mind to spin off about Donnie Yen's character John Wick chapter four Nails it you know so often in movies you see characters that feel shoehorned into the movie to set up for a spin-off that no one asked for but that's the sole reason they're there John Wick chapter four the characters are interesting in the movie they make sense in the movie and you want to see a spin-off because you want to see more of those interesting characters that's how it should be in the end what they delivered here wasn't just a John Wick movie it's a John Wick Odyssey and John Wick chapter 4 is a testament to the John Wick films being among the cleanest and most satisfying action films we get in current Western Cinema as for the negatives in John Wick chapter 4 well I guess that's that satisfying that's the word for John Wick chapter four or if you prefer awesome tacular it has the style the Flair and the world of rules that we know and love from a John Wick film also the action they know the audience is craving at this point they dial it up to 11. you know when people say oh everything's bigger doesn't necessarily mean better I don't mind saying John Wick chapter 4 is bigger and better than chapters two and three all right so John Wick chapter four have you seen it what did you think about it or how do you rank the John Wick films whatever you

"""https://youtu.be/E6LB4AF_Ams""",The Last Of Us: FINALE,this is our last week spending our last day in the apocalypse my friends we've laughed we've cried and now it's over the only apocalypse we can enjoy now is the one we call life also given a spoiler warning for the last of us I'm going to talk about The Last of Us finale gonna talk about everything that happens and basically if you haven't watched The Last of Us Series this might not be the YouTube video you want to watch or click on I'm not gonna stop you if you want to stick around I mean algorithm the [ __ ] out of it I'm just saying you've been warned now where this episode started out how it opened up I'll get to in a second funny thing for me is I was like this is the shortest episode of the entire series which is kind of that's amusing to me it's like season finale shortest episode but I guess it is pretty straightforward Joel and Ellie they're walking they're making small talk Jules acting like the cool Uncle like hey how you doing Ellie Chef Boyardee you hungry you seem a little blue right now because you just smashed a Cannibal's face in with a big blade who was gonna eat you and hey better Chef Boyardee than you it's all kind of awkward but they get to the facility in which Joel is told hey by the way just like the game it actually plays out very accurate where it's like yeah uh we got a killer in order to get this cure so you take off now Joel we got this and I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised with the body count that Joel racked up in there I mean body counts not everything but there were moments in this show where I was like I could have had more enemies well they could have had more enemies I had more enemies in the game than they had on screen unless it's a big wave of those clickers that were coming out of the ground other than that this show quite often I was like that should have been more there should have been more enemies so I was a little afraid for the scene where Joel goes to this hospital I'm like I need blood I need Slaughter I need Joel to be Terminator from T1 when he was going to the police station with some really Downer somber music oh wow look at that it's pretty much what I got so I really liked that could have gone for more bricks bludgeoning heads shock that that never happened in this show that's such a such a main weapon in the game oh well I did like the shot after Joel kills the doctor and he's like all right unhook her right now when he's leaving with Ellie there is that after shot of the Dead doctor on the ground because that's pretty much what kicks off the last of us too so yeah Jules told by the way Ellie's going to die we have to rip this cure from our brain too bad so sad and Joel was like not today everyone dies and he gets Ellie the show ends exactly where it left off in the game now in the beginning of this episode Ashley Johnson's a flashback Ashley Johnson plays Ellie's mom but you gotta love the Poetry there it's the actor who played Ellie playing Ellie's mom giving birth to Ellie this is the first time that I saw the reason behind Ellie being immune which was her mom while she was pregnant with Ellie Was Bitten and then she gave birth to Ellie and now Ellie's immune the implication being baby bump plus bite equals immune baby which does change the logistics of it a little bit it takes Ellie from being this anomaly is like we don't know how but she is immune so there's that two there's a formula to someone being immune skipping past the fact that we're dealing with the fireflies a really [ __ ] up organization that if they knew the formula and the road map that leads to someone being immune they definitely would have recreated those conditions or at least tried to I'm just saying but it does hit differently seeing the road map that led to Ellie's immunity rather than being like Ellie has a genetic anomaly and she's immune that's all I need to know for me a world like The Last of Us thrives on fear and uncertainty and not knowing how Ellie's immune only that she is immune I like that better as much as I felt this show hammered home the drama like when it wanted you to feel you felt when it wanted you to get the you know the knot in your throat it would get you there I do wish it balanced action with the drama a little more maybe that's the advantage of a game it's like oh for gameplay purposes you're gonna have more action and that's why the game is just the way to go but at a point it felt like all the infected are gone we're not dealing with infected anymore which does happen to a degree in the game but infected we're always around in the game for the show it goes out of its way to break down the lore of if you step on one of these nerve endings in the ground all the infected within a mile or whatever they'll know where you are that's a pretty intricate mechanic that you see in this one episode and after that there's just never seen again does make it feel like oh we really need this cure from Ellie it's like cure from what cure from the thing we haven't seen for half the show as much as I've enjoyed it though it is proof positive that a really good narrative-based story driven action game will never have an adaptation that's better than the game I said this in a video before I think it was one of the Resident Evil adaptations where I said video games have become so cinematic games like The Last of Us for example that they fulfill that cinematic need that an adaptation would have done before but now games just do for themselves only difference is the game has gameplay which is another level of immersion that helps draw you into the world that a live-action adaptation just can't have and that to me is the case with the last of us it was a great adaptation but the source material still does it best but in terms of adaptation I thought the show did really well I kind of see the show as The Last of Us for your parents or other people who just don't play games I say parents because that's my natural inclination my parents don't get my dad plays a living [ __ ] out of Tetris but that is it so I'm saying like for people who haven't touched a game since they felt the real tragedy of making it through Bowser's Castle and they're like oh God he throws axes too then they never touch the game since but the story of The Last of Us is still good and you feel like they should experience it now there's a series for you to show them so in the end the series of The Last of Us I thought it was really good I've enjoyed watching it weekly I've enjoyed doing videos on it weekly I don't envy the task of adapting too all right so the last of us the finale the series all of it have you seen it what did you think about it that's phrase weird why would you watch the finale without watching the series The implication is there whatever moving past it whatever you think comment below let me know and as always if you like what

"""https://youtu.be/QFeNeIDGCRc""",Children of the Corn (2023),let's play in the Metroid Prime remaster sniffing around doing that end game cleanup hadn't run across a save point in about an hour and I died all that progress all that work gone new games have made me soft anywho there's new remake of Children of the Corn did you know about that probably not I don't think a lot of people did which is why we need to talk about it because sometimes it's important to take out the trash so Children of the Corn is another remake of an old film or you can see it as a new Stephen King adaptation so prefacing I haven't seen Children of the Corn I thought I did and I was like oh yeah the one where the kid gets sucked into the wood chipper at the end oh that was two so I've seen two and three stirring a marathon in the 90s I guess I missed one but hey them's the times so I haven't seen the original haven't read the book I don't know how this Stacks up I just know how this movie Stacks up in terms of its own film and whether or not it's entertaining funny thing this movie wastes no time it it gets to it it's just like this little girl's like you know what adult's gonna die today usually I appreciate it when a film can just get to it and not waste your time but this is the kind of film that gets right to it and still feels like it's wasting your time this movie needed a lot more Intrigue a lot more character development like let's have some time to get to know these people before things just fall apart when I didn't get that in here I was met with that feeling I usually get in Stephen King adaptations which is this would be a much better mini series of some sort it's actually funny enough it felt like a mini series that was cut down to about an hour and a half an hour 45 minute film what you think that's going to look like this is exactly that there were some things in this film where I'm like I I can almost see what you were going for there which means it was probably done better in the book and if it wasn't well hey this movie came dangerously close to making sense it was when I was met with those feelings of I'm sure there's some sort of allegory of people versus Twitter on here maybe I'm just seeing what I want to say I would totally die in this Children of the Corn story wouldn't I that I'd be one of the adults they put in the pit and Berry our two leads make the best attempt at giving us something in fact uh the creepy girl Kate Moyer I believe that's her name yep Kate Moyer I felt she did a really good job at playing a creepy girl I would like to see her have a shot at doing that in a movie with a better script for her to work with and this is where I'm going to give you a light spot spoiler warning sure I'm going to talk about the big CGI thing at the end are you still gonna see this movie you can all I can do is give you my opinion what you do with that opinion that is yours to do with as you will that says life should be but if you are going to see this movie blink twice if you're in trouble right so this little girl in this movie is killing the adults to appease this I don't know this being that she calls He Who Walks you don't really know what it is see a couple times like you know a plant-looking hand you might hear a sound maybe you'll see the corn stalks moving you're like oh something's there which works that was any and all Intrigue in this movie was based around that I'm like what is this thing what is what's going on then for the climax of this film you see the big evil group corn stock CGI monster and I was like Jaws you should have done the Jaws famously the story of the film Jaws is they couldn't get the shark to look right so Spielberg was like all right we just won't show the shark for most of the movie it worked out better for the films like the textbook case of making lemonade out of lemons that's also applicable to bad CGI if you can't make the CGI look good just don't show the thing because any of the Intrigue I had was wrapped around this monster I thought was kind of cool you never really saw the monster and then you see the monster and any and all we're talking all all all all Intrigue was gone and then it was our lead versus big CGI corn stock monster thing and it was terrible funny enough you ever go on a long drive through ironically farmland or a desert just basically long stretches of flat land and you do it for a while long enough to feel like you're going about 20 miles an hour but you're really going 75 right you're moving fast but it barely feels like you're moving at all that's what this movie feels like a lot of [ __ ] happens very quickly but there's no real attempt at getting the audience to care about the characters or having some narrative thread that weaves it together so it feels like nothing's happening you get glimpses of what looks like could have been a good movie there and it's almost as though the film makes a conscious effort to avoid that the Children of the Corn remake is dog [ __ ] this movie committed not a cardinal sin but the cardinal sin it was just boring alright so Children of the Corn what's your favorite Children of the

"""https://youtu.be/NBPSOi1-wsU""",Creed 3,judging by these last couple weeks alone 2023 is quite a Majors year ridiculous I'm cutting that out I might keep it so as the title implies or absolutely clearly states Creed 3 is the third Creed movie directed by Michael B Jordan is actually his directorial debut in this chapter of Adonis Creed's life Adonis Creed is enjoying retirement enjoying the fruits of his labor he's absolutely earned it then an old friend from his past named Dame played by Jonathan major shows up Dame was an up-and-coming boxer went to prison never got his shot but now he wants that shot let the Friendship the bonding the catching up and the tension commence still gonna talk about him out the gate why because we just talked about Jonathan Majors as Kang also in my Quantum Mania review I said Jonathan Majors was great I just wish the movie around him was better well a week later I got to see that Jonathan majors and Michael B Jordan have great chemistry together also I love the fact that this movie really does make you empathize with Dane dude just wants the shot he never got you totally see why Adonis Creed's like I feel obligated to help him which in turn lays the groundwork and you feel the sense of obligation when things go bad now there was a little bit of the oh why is Rocky not in this movie conversation a little while ago after seeing the movie absolutely Rocky Balboa the character Sylvester Stallone not in this movie but after seeing the movie I want to give the movie credit for that granted and Rocky 3 when Rocky has to get his mojo back you know and he has to take out clever Lang Apollo Creed helps him out it would have been cool to see Rocky come in and help Adonis out but for the character Creed in these Creed movies that would have made it feel like he was still in Rocky's Shadow this is a movie that makes a clear statement without making the statement to the camera I mean just in terms of action and execution makes a statement that Adonis Creed is his own man the Creed movies are not in the shadow of the Rocky movies they still mention the fight between Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed after the fight's done I I'm pretty sure I heard that theme that plays at the end of Rocky fights reminds you that it's in the same world absolutely but I felt like Creed 3 made the biggest attempt and success at having Adonis Creed and the Creed movies feel like their own movies and there were a couple of creative choices going into this movie I was just looking okay if this movie is even competently directed Michael B Jordan's fine we'll see more from him but there were a couple of moments where he aims to put his mark on the movies one fight in particular where all the ambience goes down you're just in the ring with the two of them it was a cool moment where they were just in the zone there was nothing else but them there was no crowd music sound effects cheering I will say there are moments of pacing issues in this movie I run into that feeling of things I wanted to know more about that I feel would have been interesting to elaborate on I feel like the movie skips right by it maybe it's a grass is always greener on the other side kind of scenario where I'm like well because I didn't see that other stuff I wish I did but the movie would have been four hours so I guess something has to give and I'll be completely honest with you I'm kind of having a hard time framing this you know like formulating a way to illustrate my point I'm about to say I guess that's the point of it is it's a very subjective preference for me rather than an objective critique on the film for me Adonis Creed's Ark and his journey is most interesting when it's synonymous with his journey through the boxing world the character drama and the boxing in relation to that character is very much interwoven but for most of this movie Adonis Creed's retired so the boxing journey is actually Jonathan Major's character but the personal Journeys with Adonis Creed's characters so there's a separation granted all of it is leading to this big boxing match showdown at the end and I suppose that's a byproduct of telling this story of Adonis Creed's life in this phase of Adonis Creed's life I mean he is retired he's coasting his career is kind of on cruise control he's doing good but problems could arise oh hey the old friend that I feel responsible for and I'm gonna the president yup here we go feels like James T Kirk when he was an admiral it's like but I liked you better as the captain just just like that now all my personal Heroes Journey boxing Journey interwoven [ __ ] aside the movie works so that's all you need to know is whether or not it works whether or not the movie's a good time Michael B Jordan and Jonathan Majors make sure that the Chemistry Between the actors the tension between the characters it is all there and it makes for a good time it's a movie about Taking Chances forgiving forgiving others as well as yourself but it's also a movie about taking responsibility I had myself a great time in Creed 3 no alcohol required I will say this last few months been doing really good at working out eating healthier I need to do more all right so Creed Three have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to say more everyone's talking to Adonis in this movie like they were talking to Rocky in the movie Rocky Balboa like they're not as young as you used to be we got to use your strengths I was like where how the wow how [ __ ] old am I scared me I felt like I had to get my Affairs in order make out a will after I got out of the movie ,2

essentially the new Journey to the Center of the Earth movie that takes place in the MCU he said jokingly but only half the MCU Quantum realm is not bare it's not Baron it's not nothing there's actually a whole civilization down there and Michelle Pfeiffer's character was running and gunning for 30 years while she was down there though a few hours in the quantum realm was five years to us so was she down there for 30 years or was she down there for 30 hours to her I don't know we're on a new adventure Scott Lang's daughter's like hey I whipped up this device I can communicate with the quantum realm in my garage they all get sucked down into the quantum realm Kang is there is going to be a problem and I need to try to get out of there unscathed okay what I liked about this movie is very simple it's the thing we all wanted to be awesome but figured would be awesome because anyone who bets against Jonathan Majors is not playing the odds Jonathan Majors as Kang was [ __ ] epic I don't mind saying he completely made the movie the movie has some fun in there absolutely but it's the basic MCU talking points you have after you see an MCU film he showed up to work and showed up he did not only that a standout MCU villain just in the entirety of the MCU which is great not only for this film but the MCU going forward because it's been like hey who's the new Thanos all right Jonathan Majors as king we saw a glimpse of a variant of him at the end of Loki but we haven't actually seen him one of the things I liked about Jonathan majors in this movie as Kang is he didn't fall into the MCU trap that a lot of other characters in this movie fall into a lot of other characters and a lot of other MCU movies fall into MCU movies in general fall into and that's the clippiness the mcu's overwhelming urge to make every moment a funny moment have everyone have a snarky clippy response like everyone needs to be funny even when it's out of characters not everybody has to be funny have your comic relief character and that's totally fine but when the shit's going down don't compromise it with humor and this movie does do that but not when Kang is on screen when Jonathan Matrix is on screens like everyone like just stand back let him work which was a great call he's engaging as hell he's threatening you know he will follow through on his threats he's a badass villain by any metric also I will say some of the cgis actually really good in terms of setting an atmosphere for a movie that's essentially borrowing from Journey to the Center of the Earth Tron legacy absolutely in here a little bit of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome as well I thought the world visually aesthetically speaking I thought it was fun but some of the fighting I noticed like there's when everything was CGI on screen and CGI things were fighting other CGI things it's like the camera knew how to stay on it because it's well it's not a camera but there are some scenes where live action people are fighting and it's really choppy shaky cam at times couldn't believe it it's like shaky cam is the trend we never want to come back but like all Trends it's coming back and I'm seeing more of it again let's not the three acts of this film feel like three different movies sometimes like the First Act was the most interesting we get to this world it's more interesting than I thought it would be and that's because it didn't feel like an MCU movie in terms of the MCU vernacular the way people talk their clippiness it wasn't really there yeah then the ant family gets this McGuffin in which they can all understand everyone which means we can understand everyone and after that a large number of these Quantum realm life forms now talk with that cookie cutter MCU sass has been plaguing the MCU for years things like that make me feel like the mcu's a parody of itself is can we just have that die at Thor 11 Thunder I get it I'm not as young as I used to be I'm not as connected maybe I have that old man energy going along a young folk that might be watching this do you enjoy that it's actually a real question I am curious like what's the demographic they're going for so the First Act starts out interesting it starts to drop because of that second act is when we get a lot more Kang like that the third Act is batshit I am flipping a coin as to which movie had more [ __ ] going on for the last act just on screen in general this or the last Act of Aquaman it's a lot going on if for Ant-Man it feels a little weird to me granted ant-man's really the thing that dabbled into the quantum realm because well he's the character with the shrinking Tack and so why not I get it it makes sense but in terms of this Grand scope Adventure it's like Scott Lang Ant-Man that was never what I liked about him I like the smaller personal story of the first movie having him come in for a bigger fight as part of an ensemble with the Avengers that was fun that works but this movie was a lot more than Ant-Man ever needed to be there are more characters in this movie than there ever have been in an Ant-Man movie in terms of protagonist Scott Lang's character the Ant-Man vibe that blue collar everyday man who got to be a hero regardless of the odds it gets lost under the weight of this whole enormous story to be fair they come close to capturing something special with Scott Lang's Arc but this isn't horseshoes or grenades close isn't there which is fine if you choose to see the movie how I choose to see the movie which is Kang the Conqueror versus the ant fan so I don't give a [ __ ] this movie worked for me when it was Kang also modox in it it's not a sport spoiler is it everyone like I knew Modoc was in it and I don't have Twitter if I knew about it I feel like most people knew about that if you feel like that's a spoiler if you're a big Modoc fan don't get your hopes up he sucks ass in this movie I've never been a Modoc Super Fan myself like modoc's one of those characters that's bobbed and weaved in and out or through Marvel stories that I've known but I was never like oh modoc's badass I need to see Modoc in a movie and if this is Modoc in a movie no one should ever think that he was bad CGI face especially in contrast with like I said the setting looked great so bad Modoc CGI face just looks worse the whole time I was like Modoc is silly at best but worse than that and why is he even here it doesn't need to be here look in the end Ant-Man and the WASP Quantum Mania it was all right it had some fun Parts Jonathan Majors as Kang was great made the film entirely I just wish the film he was in as a whole was better I feel like this is a better time if you're drunk yeah no it's a Quantum party alright so Ant-Man in the WASP Quantum Mania have you seen it what did you think about it it's a little early for that question it'll only be early for about three days though and then every day after that it's a valid question so whatever you think comment

"""https://youtu.be/eenn0X7amgo""",FEAR,what is this like the 47th movie with the title fear I feel like they come out with a fear every couple years I feel like I should have 2023 fear 2023 movie review in the title of this I don't know if I will we'll see so fear is what happens when January has actually been really enjoyable in terms of entertainment you have that walking on eggshells feeling you're like we're gonna have to pay the pipe or hard for this [ __ ] eventually that is this week a week that looked pretty bone dry I was like what do I watch any meaning yeah sure that one the January horror film that had no press screening where I live me embargo lifted today none of this looks good so this is a low budget horror psychological Thriller film about a group of friends they come to this crickety-ass old hotel and this place is making them visualize the fear they're coming increasingly paranoid and then you see the concepts which could have been interesting before the end game bad CGI starts up now out the gate I will say this movie does feel like straight to DVD I say straight to DVD because this feels like a straight to DVD movie before Blu-rays were a thing you know 2003 2004. the thing about this movie is the script it's the screenwriting it's the classic case of it feels like friends who are just sitting around they thought of really interesting or cool things that could be in a horror movie we've all done that with our friends because that's a really fun thing to do with your friends but if you're gonna execute it if you're gonna actually do it you have to take these Concepts and put them in a movie that works or you end up having what this movie is which the horror movie things that are going down are actually cool in concept but we're not looking at concept we're looking at execution the execution right down to how the characters are acting with each other alone which is this dude because a drop of water on his head when he's sleeping he was like I'm gonna go into the attic and figure this [ __ ] out or you can call the front desk I mean granted probably wouldn't do you much good in this hotel but at least show the audience you're trying a film's job is to be a tour guide to guide the audience with the characters of the audience can actually buy or believe that the characters are acting and reacting in the way they are in the film now this dude's just kicking open doors in the Attic like hey I'm gonna figure this out I'm probably gonna run across some really sketchy rating material and some pictures to show the audience what's happening almost like I'm in a movie right it just comes across that way there's this weird coveted side plot in the movie tube which to be fair to the film it's never called covid it's just a variance which again on paper makes sense your film is about fear paranoia what can the audience relate to and yeah you're right the audience will be able to watch this and be like what the [ __ ] do you think I want to be taken there for my escapism horror film the audience knows about isolating social distancing and everything the characters in this movie were not doing in this movie TI's character might have the not coveted variant he's in his hotel room his own hotel room alone in bed doors closed we know that is isolating but all the characters in this movie were like all right he's isolated let's say we go get him and throw him into the basement so he can be isolated again I know scared group of people the theme of the entire film is fear and fear makes people act irrationally but I feel like in this case to be like yeah that scares the [ __ ] out of me but he's in his room for the time being so let's just leave him there let's I'm so afraid I'm not going to go near him the whole virus for the sake of fear and paranoia thing just it just felt awkward and out of place movie was much more interesting when it left that and then went on to focusing on other people's demons like that's where the movie thrived I'm using thrived very Loosely when the movie was at its best I'm using best Loosely it's when I saw the potential and then yeah at the end there's this weird swirly bad CGI monster thing it just doesn't look good look in the end there were a couple of ways people got dispatched when you actually see the fear going down what they see versus what's actually happening that was actually pretty cool giving credit for credits do if you could have those moments in a script and in a film that worked that complemented it could have had ourselves a pretty badass time here this is a film actually I haven't said this too often I'm gonna go ahead and say it now this is a movie I hope gets remade there is something here in the concept the horror element in here it fell flat for me the psychological Thriller elements I actually did like again in concept I walked out of this movie knowing one thing that I'm not gonna remember in T minus one day yep already forgot all right so fear you know what any of them any of the movies titled fear doesn't have to be this 2023 one what do you think of fear whatever you think comment below let me know and as always

"""https://youtu.be/2r1FMdfp3j4""",M3GAN,all right first movie of 2023 and I'm not gonna posture I'm not gonna front I was going into this movie like oh okay great I rated PG-13 Blum House horror film in January let's do that with everything that comes with that but however so I'm a three again what's up with replacing the letters with numbers really messes with the search algorithm no one's searching for mathrigan they're all searching for Megan whatever so Megan's a film about this little girl who loses her parents in a car accident and her aunt gets custody of her and her aunt works at this tech company and she's like hey we've developed this AI companion doll this AI friend yeah it's like my buddy kid's sister y'all remember you don't doesn't matter that meets AI there you go now she has a friend and from there it's pretty much the plot it's like this movie is a remake of the Child's Play remake that came out a couple years ago however unlike in the case of Child's Play where Brad duriff's voice is inseparable from the character if you don't have Brad Dura voicing Chucky you don't really have the spirit of Child's Play Megan is new Megan can be whatever she wants and this movie was actually really good at having the audience feel about Megan how they should probably feel about their phones always watching always listening everyone in the room should be terrified of that fact and they actually played that up well and I got to say if this is a movie where you're like all right sweet little AI doll robots gonna kill a lot of people and that's gonna be fun this really isn't that kind of movie maybe it's because the movie's PG-13 I do feel like the movie was probably if I found out this movie was filmed to be rated R I wouldn't be the least bit surprised there are a couple of moments where you read the lips of someone you're like that that is not what they said they probably said something that would bring this a little closer to our couple moments like that couple of audio edits where you're like those feel like two different sentences that have been stitched together or someone cut a word out but it's January we gotta get more asses in the states so PG-13 let's cut it back would not be shock if that were the case however if that was the case I'd love to see a director's cut if the rated R cut that maybe might have been filmed that long-winded tangent brings me back around to my original point is this movie really isn't the whole AI doll kills a lot of people bloodbath that you might think it is it ends up happening at the end it is fun when it happens but it's not the point of the movie but that I feel is when this movie was at its strongest it's when it starts elevating its premise this movie he actually has an incredible message to its core about human connection the dangers of using technology as a parental crutch the emotional developmental skills for a child to get lost in that execution that's something that's far scarier than AI killing people that we may or may not have to deal with in the year 20 50 something because that's something that's very real now I was actually really impressed this film dealt with such heavy subject matter you're actually pretty invested with the emotional state of this child and how Megan's actually bad for the kid on an emotional level the kid thinks Megan is great but kids would think that cake and ice cream for every meal of the day is great so there's that and the last act happens and at times it is silly I mean the movie actually is silly I'm not just talking about the fact that Megan stole my dance moves this movie actually does have we'll say some tonal conflict you just want to line up everybody the cast members will be like all right raise your hand who here thinks they're in a comedy who here thinks they're in a serious horror film who here thinks they're in an emotional film about family and human connection yep those are all those are all different hands and something like that doesn't have to feel like it's in three movies just did in this one it just didn't feel like it flowed smoothly also I feel like this movie could have been 15 minutes shorter thereabouts but in the end Megan I had a surprisingly good time with I was getting ready man I was like all right let's go to Megan let's [ __ ] on a bad PG-13 hover wow I actually enjoyed that for completely different reasons than I thought I would it wasn't the horror it wasn't the death it wasn't any Slaughter you see some frankenstitching from other films and their premise but it's a testament that you can do that you can borrow you can actually have the premise of a movie that came out a couple years ago but to your core you can build something that does feel unique I think if they play their cards right this could become a franchise I'd actually like to see a Megan too what would the title of that look like mithrigan too but this is the last we saw of Megan the character I'd really be bummed out in the end I shockingly had a good time with this one no alcohol required all right so Megan first film of the year have you seen it just came out doubt it but have you seen it or been searching for this review did you type in mathrigan or Megan tell me how that search algorithm is working out whatever you think comment below let me know and as always if you like what

"""https://youtu.be/_PLKQEPWzbo""",The Whale,of Ryan who Darren Aronofsky filmed some light-hearted holiday Christmas cheer so the whales directed by Darren Aronofsky Stars Brendan Fraser was written by Samuel D Hunter who wrote the play this film is based off of he's credited for writing the film I don't know if he actually wrote a new screenplay for the film or if Aronofsky just took the script and was like yeah that works this is a script for our movie The Script for the play because there are clips on YouTube of scenes from the play and I'm like that is verbatim the film The film's about a man named Charlie who internet says the character is 600 pounds I don't know if they actually give a weight in the film point is he's given a very Grim prognosis from his friend who's a nurse so we decide to try to reconnect with his estranged daughter played by Sadie Singh which it doesn't surprise me that Darren Aronofsky took this on you look at the wrestler the wrestler is about an estranged father and daughter and then the estranged father tries to reconnect with his daughter after he's given a very serious medical prognosis the whale is about an estranged father and daughter and the father tries to reconnect with the daughter after he's given a very serious medical prognosis and let's get it out of the way first let's just do it let's talk about Brandon Fraser because we we heard he crushes it in this film we heard he is a shoe-in for an Oscar nomination I do slightly disagree I think he's a shoe in for an Oscar win I need to know that I one thing right was my life but you can say that about Darren Aronofsky films in general the dude knows how to pull performances every one of his films like Noah's the least Aronofsky film of all of them so if you want to leave that one out sure but you look at every other film he's ever done there's a performance in each of those films where you're like that's incredible if I were in Vegas I I'd put my bets on Brendan Fraser winning for all you good folks who lost money on that Patty the Baddie fight here's your Mulligan don't take my word for it I'm not giving you gambling advice don't do that don't take that I talk about movies on YouTube for a living don't listen to me I'm just saying I would make that bet fair in Vegas can you bet on the Oscars in Vegas he is incredible in this film if you had an actor who did less than the work he does the film really wouldn't work as well as it does seems like it yeah no [ __ ] kind of statement but the cast is very small one main actor Brendan Fraser for supporting actors and that's it five supporting actors including Dan the pizza guy but I'm telling you it's a very intimate film and one of the things that helps is the fact that you never see the fat suit makeup when you're seeing Brendan Fraser's character I've seen that on TV other movies you see the fat suit you see the makeup it just kind of takes you out of it that's another Oscar this film might be up for best makeup because it was an incredible job well done and seeing Brendan Fraser give us a performance like this is something special maybe 20 years ago or so he wasn't in the place to pull from that much pain but I see his talent as it's like a treasure like Berry gold and imagine someone panning for gold and they get a few nuggets and they're like oh great that's enough looks like it's tapped but then two feet down or 20 years later however you want to see it there's this huge gold deposit the size of Fort Knox that's Brandon Fraser's Talent we didn't know it was there we thought we'd seen it all we thought we'd gotten it all he had much more to give now the film in terms of tone is very man um dark yes but the clusterphobic as well it makes sense that it's based off of a play because you're hanging out with this guy in his living room for 99 of the film you look at cost effective stage plays they usually have that one location that the story takes place in so your watches you're like oh yeah this is totally based off of a stage play and that intimate if not claustrophobic feeling is aided by the 4x3 aspect ratio presentation now this film is decidedly Darren Aronofsky and for for my part that excites me it's like Darren Aronofsky Quentin Tarantino Christopher Nolan James Cameron these are all directors that when they come out with something new it feels like an event to me I can only describe it as like it's game day and your favorite team is playing you just have to watch it right now you don't want to wait for TiVo you don't want to record it watch it later you need to watch it right now people still record stuff or is it just on demand now is that what it's called whatever you can't wait to pop in the VHS and watch it later after you adjust the tracking there I said it but also this being a Darren Aronofsky film I can say this phrase this is not for everybody and I'll be right I can say that about every Aronofsky film before and every Darren Aronofsky film he does from now until the end of his career until he retires now this film is not going to be for everybody I've already seen chatter online where some people find it problematic but I myself I found something very special in here I found a very heartfelt story about pain loss human connection family connection everybody in this film has at least a moment where they just come across as a little rough around the edges some more than others even the super likable people have a couple of moments of dialogue where it's like you're kind of being high and mighty right now but the film also gives context to pain so you see both sides of it you see how they are you see why they are the way they are that's the real magic right there that's the mythical element because that's a luxury we are rarely afforded in life with the people we actually interact with but everyone in this film is dealing with something because everyone in life always is that's just life I feel like this is one of those films you're going to be in one of two camps and that's it it's either uncomfortably unenjoyable or you're gonna find something special with it I think there's a lot of room for in between for some I feel like Brandon Fraser's performance might be the reason to go see it even if you don't generally enjoy the film but that's absolutely fair for some folks out there a Powerhouse performance is enough but honestly it's not just Brendan Fraser I mean what he gives us is truly something special absolutely but Hong Chow in the movie has a couple of scenes where she is bringing it I feel like she's in the conversation for the Oscar as well or should be this is a film with layers and that's something special when I come out of the movie theaters usually you watch a movie and well that's what the movie is and that's what you take home and I word vomit on camera and there you are this is a film I feel like I can peel back over time and enjoy the process of doing so so I myself I buy all of Darren aronofsky's films I say that because yes I feel this film is worth watching and worth buying on Blu-ray like I'm the guy I I can watch Requiem for a Dream every Friday like I've said before in my videos in fact I might I might actually watch it that's right while you're watching a Christmas story I'll I'll be watching Requiem for a Dream Merry Christmas all right so the whale have you seen it what did you think about it what's your favorite Darren Aronofsky film whatever you think comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more

trial see where it takes you and thank you once again to noon for sponsoring this video i do appreciate it and now we get to the review because that's kind of what we do here so the 355 is an espionage spy thriller with a great cast but it's that espionage did you see a trailer for that movie where you're like oh that looks interesting and now you're like oh oh the movie came out already i totally forgot about it that's 355. it revolves around a crew of spies or former spies throughout the world there's this device in terms of cyber terrorism this is a super bad device it can manipulate shut down it could basically do anything to anything in the digital world i mean when i say in terms of cyber terrorism it's now the worst digital cyber terrorist device ever devised for cinema so this crew of spies generally speaking led by jessica chastain like we don't know who to trust we don't know if we can trust our agencies but they do feel like they can trust each other so they're going to save the day and yeah the cash in this movie legit cast jessica chastain diane krueger lupita nyong'o penelope cruz and this great cast probably adds to the disappointment of the movie the fact that the movie's just okay with a cast like that what i liked about the movie there were a couple moments in here great moments of tension and just the acting among the actors that really sells the tension lupita nyong'o in particular was a standout when it comes to that also as much as the movie has fun with his premise and fun with the cast and crew it's not a comedy they don't go for laughs and jokes feels weird to be like that's a positive but in this day and age a lot of movies they do go for the jokes and it kind of takes me out of the movie this movie didn't do that and as much as i will say when it's going down at the end of the movie like the end shootout the last shootout in this movie was actually pretty sweet would have been better if i could see more of it because yes this movie does that shaky cam i shouldn't be too surprised even the matrix does shaky cam now nothing is safe it's not just shaky cam it's the editing also when someone does something as simple as picks up a gun and shoots a few people i don't need a bunch of edits to give me a bunch of different angles with that just frame it up let me see what's going on john wickett or for this female-centric film jane wicket if you prefer the terminology i don't care just frame it up well i noticed that was going to be a problem earlier on in the movie when people are chasing people and the camera's doing that i was like oh god i thought we were it's 2022. i thought we were past it the biggest hurdle this movie has to overcome is the fact that it just feels 20 years behind the times it feels 20 years too late it does feel like this aggregate like someone sat down was like hey it'd be cool if we had jason bourne action movie in a mission impossible type setting with a new crew a little bit of ocean's 11 thrown in there because it has the flavor of that too and if it was this jason bourne ocean's 11 mission impossible movie that came out when ocean's 11 and jason bourne came out and jason board's born identity you know what i mean it'd feel like this cool hybrid of the two like someone saw both the movies was like oh hey let's fuse them great feels new feels like the marriage of cinema i've wanted for the past year and a half because it's the early 2000s but in 2022 this movie just feels like it's late to the action movie spy thriller party i don't know the story of production for this movie but if i found out that the 355 was written back in the early 2000s and was just sitting on a shelf and got dusted off recently and they decided to make it into a movie finally i wouldn't be surprised not at all and that out of date at the very least late to the party feeling has to do with some of the plot twists too there's some plot twists in here like didn't see that coming digits like i did because i've seen these movies since you know the 80s 90s 2000s to now yeah it might have been mind-blowing back in 1987. it's just not in 2022. i didn't hate the movie like i walked out of the movie going the movie was fine it was okay it was it was fine but there are so many spy thriller movies espionage movies heist movies out there that are so much more than just fine 24 hours in a day this movie's two hours long which it feels a bit longer than that like it didn't at a point i was like this movie has really good pacing because i thought we were in the third act and it was just like oh it's not ending it's still going it's still going it's still ending yeah you know that movie has great time management thing i was just thinking i take it back but a two hour movie is one twelfth of your day am i gonna be like hey you should watch this movie you should take up one-twelfth of your day on this movie i can't do that movies like this happen every year at the end of the year in december when i'm making my top 10 best top 10 worst list i'm scrolling through my reviews seeing what i reviewed i'll run across my review the 355 and it'll be like oh wow totally forgot about that movie would have been better suited to come out in 2003-ish but for 2022 i'm just not gonna remember the movie in t-minus one day yeah wait what are we talking about all right so the three five five have you seen it what did you think about it did you forget that it was even coming out did you know it was out right now or what's your favorite espionage and or spy thriller whatever it is whatever you think comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more you ,0
"""https://youtu.be/CKKMnknNjFc""",Avatar: The Way Of Water,I'm getting this to you a day late a dollar short I don't think so but thank you for your patience I was hanging out with a friend in Vegas he needed to get his mind off of some BS badly and he was like I've never been to Vegas do you want to go to Vegas I was like dude I got your back let's go to Vegas let's get your mind off of it because that's what friends do friends will have your back even if they miss the pre-embargo screening to the first James Cameron film in 13 years now the way of water is out it's time to punch on and do that only monetizable skill I have talk so Avatar the way of water is the sequel to Avatar it's been many years for us many years for them Jake Sully now has a family life is great but the sky people have returned so let the Clash commence also learning the way of water that's that's also a thing in here now let's be honest and address it Avatar it gets a lot of [ __ ] but I was just I've never been there mentally with the movie I thought Avatar was great in 2009 I've watched it since then many times I've watched it recently to brush up for this movie yeah dances with Smurfs don't give a [ __ ] I think it's great I apologize for none of it but it'll be interesting to see how the way of water plays out since the landscape The Cinematic landscape is now different in 2022 than it was in 2009 after watching the movie I can say a couple things one my faith in James Cameron I feel has paid off because I thought I crushed it with this one and two that might actually work out for this movie because it's easy to see big budget movies being this industrial grade Studio cash grab because that's kind of what we see with big budget movies now but I don't think that's the case with the way of water so first of all technologically speaking this movie is Head and Shoulders above anything you've ever seen in your life so many times I was watching this I was like this is it's easy to forget it's CGI there's actually there's been a couple times I've met fans and are like dude do you really think Avatar the way of water looks great because I don't think the trailer visually I don't think it looks any better than the previous Avatar movie I just think we've hit that phase in life where the only way to see the detail and the resolution is to see it on a bigger screen I guess that's pretty smart for 20th century Studios which is Disney let's just be honest about it because I've watched the trailer on a little screen and I've watched it on the big screen on the big screen it does look better at first when you're in the forest you're like okay it does look good but I've seen this before but when they get to the water stuff and they're hanging out the water civilization it's unlike anything you've ever seen James Cameron in the world of Pandora the Avatar movies they've always had that they've always had this this bonds between the people of the world and the animals of the world very Circle of Life thing going on but it's like James Cameron's very conscious of the fact that being in the world of Pandora is part of the fun is part of the charm it's part of the glory of the movie so it gives you more than a few moments of these awe-inspiring scenes where it's just like ah let's just have the audience take it in in fact let's have characters taken in too because it does look that [ __ ] incredible this movie does the high frame rate which is essentially doubling the frame rate I don't think it's the only format you can watch the movie and I'm sure you can find it in lower frame rate not all projectors can do that point is is something that the first Hobbit movie did and then everyone who saw the movie early was like wow that was weird and then strangely for the next two screenings it wasn't in high frame rate at least not in Seattle maybe it's the Technologies advanced in the subsequent 10 years since but I actually enjoyed it in this movie I thought it worked a lot better for Avatar way of water I thought it was a lot more immersive sometimes to its detriment absolutely couples things in particular I can think of really just one scene where we're in space and it's turning and I'm like yeah the camera's turning that looks great yeah it's so immersive my brain is telling me we're spinning and I'm kind of getting nauseous also the thing that this movie does really well that a lot of movies that have that time Gap need to do you know when they're dealing with a couple Generations is have both Generations be relevant and have the story used both optimally usually when dealing with that conundrum we're talking about universes and worlds that have been around actively for a while this is just simply the first James Cameron movie since the previous James Cameron movie enough time has passed where now he needs to deal with that because he saw the 12-year gap between Titanic and Avatar and he was like I can beat that 13 years hence here we are but I did think this movie did a great job at using the two generations in the teary Jake Sully and their kids and having them all work you know having them all optimized I felt like natiri did get a little more sidelined in this movie than she was in the previous movie she was a huge part of the previous movie but it more revolves around Jake and the fact that he is this leader but now he's also a parent in the previous movie Jake was like oh yeah I'm a military leader last Shadow baby it's fine I'll help them all fight but now he's like I don't want my kids to get hurt and die in fighting so I'm going about it differently but then his kids are like we want to fight we want to help so they're going on their Quest I would say the kids are actually in the Forefront in here it is building the story I mean there's like six planned Avatar sequels they're definitely going to stick around and become more prominent as time goes on this was the film where we had to give a [ __ ] about them and I thought James Cameron a good job with that I mean there were a couple of intense scenes where I was like see this is why I like Avatar they're not just nine foot tall Smurfs there's Peril happening that that dude's in danger and I care there was a bit of familiarity in a couple scenes um just in the fact that when I was sitting down to watch this movie I remember thinking this is going to feel so different than the first movie because a huge part of the first movie was Jake Sully training to be a navi and then he becomes one of the people and that's the plot of the movie and to my surprise it's called way of water so it shouldn't have been too surprised but in its execution Jake and his family are hanging out with this Navi civilization that's very water-based their bodies have evolved to use water in their culture and their civilization as the navi we saw in the previous film evolved to use the forest all of it seems really well thought out and executed with passion so that sense of learning a new culture is actually in this movie as well it's just there's no flip like that in the first one where it's like oh man I guess these folks aren't so bad I'm gonna help them no they're always the good guys this is good guys hanging out with good guys they're there's a bit of that High School tension though and I do want to give props to composer Simon Franklin for stepping in after the late great James Horner passed away some big shoes to fill and to be fair there were a couple of moments where a track was either reused or it was just recomposed for this movie but it's the same track from the first movie like that song when home tree gets bombed his home tree's down all the navi are crying and they're freaking out and you know that that tune that's very memorable from the first movie that same song plays in this movie I was like are you just reusing tracks just gonna reuse it but this sounds like a James Cameron call to me not a Simon Franklin call I want to give props to Simon Franklin because music is very important in the world of Pandora and I felt he did a great job recapturing it the movie's a little over three hours long which is pretty lengthy but I feel like he does it's an earned run time it does make me think like wait is there James Cameron always has director's Cuts is there a directors because they're going to be a special edition of this do you have a four hour cut of way of water we'll see I guess and in the end I gotta say Avatar the way of water is proof that if you're playing the odds you never bet against James Cameron honestly if you didn't like the previous Avatar movie I don't think this is gonna win you over but for fans of Avatar I think a way of water is going to be a great next chapter once again Pandora is a world in a movie that you're not just watching in a movie you're living it James Cameron's a director that gets that 2022 comic book movie MCU budget but he uses it to keep that old school movie-going experience alive his movies feel like passion projects still it's actually a very unique movie going experience James Cameron films he's a guy who does his own thing wants to entertain the living [ __ ] out of people and does it in a way where you're like yeah movies used to feel like this and it's really awesome to see in 2022 maybe eventually Avatar is going to feel that way it's going to feel like that studio cash grab like I said there are a few Avatar sequels planned out I'd be shocked if he does all of them and if they're successful enough they're going to have spin-offs and Disney plus series there might eventually come a time where it just feels like soulless nonsense but that time is not today I felt Avatar the way of water was a memorable experience in 2022. the visuals look unreal it has a classic storytelling Spirit about family at the center and the last 45 minutes of this film is a satisfying action spectacle Avatar the way of water is awesome tacular it's like this I was actually going to give it bite on Blu-ray and I just remembered I'm a grumpy old [ __ ] now I just want to kick my feet back and enjoy the [ __ ] out of this so there you have it all right so Avatar the way of water have you seen it what did you think about it or what's your favorite James Cameron film you can rank them if you want that's always fun to do

that and now sing it with me violent night holy [ __ ] so Violet Knight's new Christmas film new Christmas classic well that's up to you but it's pretty much the chatter that you've heard unless you've never heard of it in which case glad to introduce you but the chatter online that I've heard is this is Die Hard meets home alone with Santa Claus die hard yes home alone so sprinkled in there and there's a scene but it's not like the brick and mortar of the film Die Hard yes that's in line which means it's a pretty easy description it's Christmas Eve John Leguizamo and his crew of Bandits they infiltrate this Mansion because they want all the money that's in the vault and that is right when Santa who's making his rounds that night because his Christmas Eve ends up at that house and so he's pretty much the John McLean just funny because the movie makes references to die hard and home alone it's very it's very self-aware and it being called violent night and the poster being that well you know Santa's about to beat some ass now David Harbor as Santa Claus is incredible in this film I first saw the trailer at cinemacon and I was like I need to watch that movie right now but he's a vulnerable sanity he's been doing this a while he's starting to question what's it all for I mean people are getting shittier I don't think the movie actually expressly says that specifically but we're just being real here right so this movie amazingly uses this Santa in a rut premise as Santa finding Redemption finding a renewed sense of purpose of Christmas like David Harbor as action movie Santa Claus is exactly how it is in this movie is exactly how he is you think of David Harbor Santa in a rut Action Hero Santa Claus time for some Seasons beatings Santa Claus is coming to town I gotta watch yep but it's more than that it's more than just guy in a Santa suit because that's what it would have felt like it would have felt like oh a guy in a Santa suit if it was just David Harbor in a Santa suit kicking ass the movie takes strides to illustrate that this is Santa Claus you know what feels like a Christmas movie I'm not talking about the goons in this movie having Christmas code names I mean that's fun and all I'm talking about Christmas themes and Christmas music being woven into the musical score the connection between Santa Claus and this little girl is one of the hostages in this house I thought that was that was a huge amount of heart in this film I didn't expect to be there we didn't give me those heartfelt arcs in a film that I didn't think were going to be there I mean that's always a plus also it being in a Christmas movie to make it feel like a Christmas movie that's even better also they do some really cool things with Santa lore and here you get a bit of backstory so you can buy the fact that this Santa Claus is actually able to kick ass and it makes sense and little details the devil's in the details when it comes to lore like Santa Claus having to go to the chimney and touch his nose to go up the chimney I was like well that's how it is in the story yeah I didn't have to do that but I just appreciate these little details where you can tell someone's like no it's important that he touches his nose there were some characters in this movie that felt cartoony it's almost a growing epidemic I almost understand why because really in terms of the hostages in terms of the people who are in this Mansion it's the little girl and a crew of who gives a [ __ ] little girl stole the show when it comes to the hostages I think it's because she's the reason Santa actually stuck around to help she builds a bond with Santa Claus but no one else did so it's like if it was just a little girl this one hostage and there was nobody else Santa would have still stuck around on the other hand if the little girl wasn't there and it was just a crew of adults these bickering family members um I don't know that Santa would have stuck around so there's that either case she's clearly the valuable one for the heart and soul of the film and everyone else is just kind of there also yeah I feel like the movie goes on for 10 minutes or so too long I'm ballparker but I feel like this whole new crew gets brought into this movie just so Santa had more people to bludgeon and kill on one hand fun when it's happening pacing wise movie could have been shorter but in the end I absurdly enjoyed myself with this movie I actually feel to its core it does maintain the spirit of a Christmas themed movie it has the Christmas spirit alive live here also a lot of bloody death too I had a great time no alcohol required I'll be honest with you I enjoyed this movie I'm totally down for a prequel and or a sequel I want to see more from this world I

for sponsoring this video I do appreciate it and now let's talk about a movie which is the epitome of the phrase I'm not crying you're crying so black panther wakanda forever is the newest film in the MCU the sequel to Black Panther and is a film that took on a seemingly impossible task in which the real-life tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman has worked into the script of this movie in which King t'challa has passed and while this tragedy has befallen wakanda a new character named Neymar or no more I know internet's like his name is Neymar they call him no more in the movie but in the movie some people call him Neymar some call him no more I appreciate people like me who'd suck with names there's no way we can mispronounce it that's nice but he's from a super secret underwater civilization that's legally not Atlantis though in the comic books it's Atlantis but they can't say that point is it's a civilization of blue people who live in water as part of the MCU not the other property that Disney also owns and now they're having conflict with wakanda emotions are high tensions are high which before I get to what really carried the film for me I'm going to talk about it's basically I'm going to treat this like a dish I'm going to start on the outside and just work my way in so I thought Neymar was a good villain I say that to say that to address it because it's an MCU villain you know it's usually that's the caveat where it's like yeah so weak part the MCU villain but there's definitely a conscious effort to make Namor part of the plot you know make them a very big piece of this story also early on in the movie when the troops do the first attack I was like oh these guys are scary I chalked that one up to the musical score as well the music in this movie I thought it was great it was exciting when it needs to be also Eerie when it needs to be they were almost like specters the film does a good job but early on getting your fight or flight senses going at the presence of them also the performances the performances are great all around but you do have your standouts like Angela Bassett couple of scenes in particular I was like she she has never lost it we all knew that yeah one scene in particular it was just it was a very emotionally heart-wrenching monologue and when this film has the characters give these emotional moments because of the passing of King t'challa it it's very clear or rather I should say it's unclear as to whether or not you're seeing the character grieve or the actor grieve but not in a way that compromised it in a way that enhanced the experience it's not like you're sitting there going oh I see the actor rather than the character but in a very real way where you feel The Grieving through the screen but really it sure is emotional story her emotional Journey that is the core of this film that's when I was most engaged right there in fact early on in this film there was a moment where it establishes that a fulcrum in here is shuri's scientific mind and her spiritual pain are conflicting or at the very least there's friction among those two parts of her and I was like I'm in this is I think we've hit Peak MCU existential crisis let's go and then the movie's like yeah but we are the MCU so we'll Circle back around to that in about two hours it much the same way I'll Circle back around to Leticia Wright and how she's a complete and total Legend in this film uh but first I mean I'd love to say everything worked but not everything did because as I was so invested in this emotional Journey this emotional quest in this film we then go and hang out with side characters Martin Freeman's brought into this movie again there's another side character a new character that's brought into it anytime I'm hanging out with these characters I'm like I I don't think this movie had to be two hours 40 minutes long it's like you can't Phantom edit them out because they are woven into the plot but when I'm hanging out with these characters I was thinking a couple of script revisions I think could have streamlined a couple of Concepts we could have saved ourselves some time also as much as I like the not atlanteans legally speaking Yeah when they first show up like I said it was super scary because the musical score is really aiding in that and it was a new civilization with a new technology that's generally speaking new for this world but after that when you start getting to know the civilization I didn't feel the film hammered home the fact that this civilization is as technologically Superior and threatening as the film is telling me they're supposed to be like wakanda's wakanda well-established they're technologically speaking ahead of everybody it's not even close and this not Atlantis civilization is supposed to feel like they are a threat to wakanda but if you're looking at them their Tech their numbers you're like I think wakanda could still kick their ass fine it's like I woke up in a world where wakanda just only had one aircraft ever in the entire place but the movie said they're a big threat so you know I guess they're a big threat for this film so more falls on Neymar like he's the one who is the threat and I do also appreciate the fact that director Ryan coogler doesn't make this movie you know MCU comedy to the point of a parody couple of humorous moments yeah mostly from umbaku because Winston Duke is a legend as well he's just one of those dudes that on screen can say a line it's like well now this is your scene you did that he has that super power mbaku isn't used as much in this film as he was the previous film but what he is used it is gold never felt like I was watching an MCU comedy slash parody I really appreciate that but in the end all in all I thought the film was solid I give all the props in the world to Ryan coogler for pulling that off the entire cast for pulling that off and I Gotta Give special love to Leticia Wright she stepped up to a plate I don't think she ever really signed on to step up to Chadwick Boseman tragically passes then she's told she's going from support character to emotional focal point of the entire next film I can't imagine the pressure of that and she carried it she was what made this film at its best when it was at its best it was because we were following her her emotional Journey her story when I had the feels she was there when I started getting the man tears she was there her emotional quest in this film is absolutely what made it for me I'll say I had myself a great time with this one no alcohol required all right so black panther wakanda forever I know it comes out in a few days I feel like asking you have you seen it what did you think about it it's a little you know Hasty

once again to nordvpn for sponsoring this video I do appreciate it and now a video game to movie adaptations those are always always a sure thing foreign is a film adaptation of the Beloved video game franchise Uncharted the Uncharted games are one of those scenarios where the games get a lot of praise and they're absolutely deserving of all that praise the one caveat the thing I can say is the first game shows a bit of its age other than that so in this film adaptation we have Tom Holland as Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg is Sully okay come on and this is the story of how they meet though we saw a glimpse of that in the third game and now they're on their first adventure together to find the lost gold of Magellan as a fan of the games let's go into this movie like okay it's not gonna be as good as the games but you know maybe we can have some fun and some fun is in here but as for the casting Tom Holland is Nathan Drake it's I I never fully bought him as Nathan Drake even Young Nathan Drake I love Tom Holland as much as the next person I think he's great but he never felt like someone out there was like oh Tom Holland because we found the best Nathan Drake possible it felt like right Tom Holland's a superstar and it was before Spider-Man no way home owned [ __ ] face in the box office all right Tom Holland great we have him in the movie fantastic and then it feels like the rest of the movie was molded around that one casting decision don't know I wasn't in the room just telling you how it feels it feels like all right Tom Holland great he's a bit young all right we'll just make everyone young and we'll make it an origin story a prequel not really because it's not really a link to the games it's just kind of an origin story all right we'll have young Chloe Frazier and younger Sully in which my counter argument would be well the characters in The Uncharted series are far more interesting when they're in their 30s than their 20s I mean seeing it as an origin story I don't know that Tom Holland Nathan Drake would grow to be this person this character who has the big biggest body count of any video game character on Earth but no Tom Holland Drake would snap a neck I snapped a lot of necks in those games Mark Wahlberg being cast as Sully was absolutely proof that the Dare program was a failure because someone out there was high as [ __ ] when they made that call having a young Sully sure Mark Wahlberg doesn't look like Sully sound like Sully or act like Sully I mean it'd be like okay going down there without some Firepower go talk to that Rudd Merchant we just passed got me guns bullets and [ __ ] he's not really a rug merchant Ah that's what I'm talking about I will say one of the standouts in this movie was Antonio Banderas he captures the spirit of what an Uncharted villain would be he's not based on an Uncharted villain that came before him but you look at this guy you're like you would be an Uncharted villain I thought Antonio Banderas in this movie was great as for the action in this movie entertaining yes plausible no ridiculous yep CGI of course but there was entertainment there the best action sequence in this movie I think is a scene on the plane but it was also awesome in the game and better in the game so I'll just play it in the game and that's what this movie runs into it's the point I brought up in my review of the new Resident Evil movie and the point I brought up was a lot of these video games these days fulfill that cinematic experience in fact more so and better than a movie can because you are playing through it you're not just watching it you're a part of it so having a video game to film adaptation for these action games isn't as necessary as it once was being in the plane when it all starts going to [ __ ] and the back opens up and cargo and people just start getting blown out the back including you while you are a part of it experiencing it is way more intense than Tom Holland doing it on a green screen I will say this on the plane there's this thing that happens in the plane where I was like well the movie is just fundamentally worse now luckily not long after that you're in the last Act of the movie in which this movie goes balls crazy ridiculous it's like it doesn't even care it's like yeah you're looking for plausibility out of here with that [ __ ] we are just cgiing the most impossible past implausible zero [ __ ] given CGI action Fest you could possibly think of and they commit to it credit to that I can't say I didn't have fun with that ridiculous [ __ ] just in a world where Uncharted is a tent pull franchise of action games I think of quintessential game franchise of action adventure exploring I will mentally go to Uncharted this movie is fine but pretty indistinguishable from any other Adventure Movie out there think of an adventure movie where people explore and they're looking for a treasure this and that not one of the ones that really stands out where you're like whoa that was surprisingly good but one of the ones where you're like okay that happens another one of those this Uncharted movie doesn't feel much different than those you remember that fan film that Uncharted fan film that had Nathan Fillion as Nathan Drake that feels more like Uncharted than this Uncharted movie this Uncharted movie feels like Muppet Babies like the Muppet Babies version of Uncharted you know where you have the grown-up adult or otherwise seasoned versions of the characters and then because well it's cool to show younger versions of those characters will you make that too okay again don't hate this Uncharted movie but if you go into this movie as an Uncharted fan I feel like you're going to find it lacking who knows maybe it'll be a better time if you're drunk yeah this is the hardware I was talking about anyhow the Uncharted movie have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought comment below let me know and as

you once again to truebill for sponsoring this video i do appreciate it and now i rip myself away from the final fantasy 6 pixel remastered remaster i've been looking forward to for quite some time and i do it to talk about garbage why because that could be fun too i guess so texas chainsaw massacre is a sequel to the texas chainsaw massacre sans and it's one of those movies that's a new sequel that rat cons everything except the original movie so retcons all the other sequels which i'm pretty sure was exactly what that movie texas chainsaw 3d did because if at first you don't succeed keep making garbage the rule of hollywood this is the worst mulligan ever it literally feels like you only have two lanes all right mulligan and now i have one land i how did i get worse that's what this movie feels like to be fair i haven't seen texas chainsaw 3d since it was in theaters i saw it the once which is probably how often i'm going to watch texas chainsaw massacre so getting into the plot of this movie after i've just bitched about it for this long there's a group of young people these young entrepreneurial types these gen zers who all go to this ghost town they're like hey we'll buy it and auction it off and bring life into it i guess or create a cult compound somewhere in the middle of nowhere i don't know the point is that's what they want to do turns out leatherface is there and he gets really pissed then something else happens in the movie that really makes leatherface mad now leatherface goes on his killing spring up against a bunch of characters you don't care about so you're kind of rooting for leatherface to kill people and in that this movie does have a couple scenes where i was like oh that's a nice bloodbath let's do it the blood the slaughter you know you're kind of there at that point and that can work i've experienced movies where i was like yeah i'm just kind of rooting for the bad guy to kill people that's fine that's what happens when i watch final destination movies i'm waiting for this fatalistic death just to weed these people out or saw i'm like you go jigsaw that's why i'm here like example there's a scene in a bus where just this massacre is happening you're like okay i could kind of get into this your lizard brain kicks on you're like sure it's just oozing and dripping with carnage good enough right but then that other part of your brain kicks on that average [ __ ] human being brain kicks on and you're like wait wait wait wait because leatherface has the most silent chainsaw ever in this movie yeah the cool thing about leatherface or chainsaws in general in movies when they're used as massacre equipment is that they have that that rumble sound and you know it's coming after you it's scary you're like oh [ __ ] gotta be quiet gotta be quieter than the chainsaw in this movie when it's idle because it makes no sound whatsoever it just goes from nothing silent to so silent in fact that when the chainsaw is on but idle people are trying to creep away like we gotta open this window it's all leather faces like what was that that i just heard over my idle chainsaw that's making no sound on screen it wasn't an electric chainsaw it did make idle gas-powered sounds intermittently throughout the movie just sometimes it made it sometimes it didn't you know when making this movie someone was like how would leatherface hear the slight window creak open over the chainsaw do you think anyone's gonna notice that no not at all it's only the internet and social media no one's gonna catch that and point it out forever well i wouldn't say forever because no one's gonna remember this movie no that's not the writing i'm not writing it up yet i'm still going i have things to say you want to talk about unrealistic there's a scene in this movie where someone gets straight up to someone gets the chainsaw the full brunt of it someone gets the mkx through the gut lifted into the air it just revs the chainsaw ass and blood just falling on leatherface and then later on far after this person should have died because they should have died right then and there the person's alive long enough to pop a shot at leatherface then dies i was like well it's official texas chainsaw massacre is it's a ghost movie because that person was not [ __ ] alive the big thing this movie does it takes inspiration from the 2018 halloween movie you know 2018 halloween movie was the sequel that was a retcon of all the other sequels retconned everything except the original movie and it had the survivor of the original movie come back to face the monster and that's what this movie does it has the character sally the survivor of the original texas chainsaw massacre movie to come and face the monster in a way that's just anti-climactic and sucks lurie strode in 2018 halloween she's the main point this movie sally just kind of seems like an afterthought thrown into this movie briefly and for no reason whatsoever like if she wasn't in the movie at all movie would be no different i really mean that actually that's really sad when you say it out loud but that's true she wasn't in the movie the movie just wouldn't change at all except for like one scene where she comes in she's like run at a point the movie ends with zero payoff whatsoever and [ __ ] go okay i watched that could have done anything else with my time that's really why i'm doing this video because i watched it i was like [ __ ] if i'm not making a video about this i'm getting that time back plus i'm spending more time talking about it but you know i'll at least use my experience watching this movie to keep the channel machine turning there's no way i wasn't going to talk about this movie i have to make it worth it somehow and if for nothing else i'm letting you know you definitely shouldn't you should not that makes it all worth it my friends use my pain to your advantage oh god i forgot about this but i have to touch on i have to talk about it because it's in the movie again for no real reason now this could have worked out they could have used this for something in the movie they just don't there's these brief flashback moments in this movie like really brief you know at the end of joker where joker's sitting there and he goes i just thought of a joke and it really briefly shows bruce wayne and his dead parents the flashback scenes are that quick but they're there to show you that at least one of the characters in this movie is a survivor of a school shooting yeah it's in here for character development i guess doesn't really lead to anything it's just kind of there at best it's really awkward at worst it's just another part of texas jade's on massacre in the end texas chainsaw massagers it's proof that they should just stop trying to do this i feel like texas chainsaw massacres kind of like terminator someone out there has it in their mind where they're like no no this is a franchise we should really keep going with this it's like nah i think the best years are behind us just let it go i have come to tell you that texas chainsaw massacre it sawed off dog [ __ ] sorry i was out of town on vacay relaxing would have gotten you this video last weekend um but i didn't to anyone who saw this movie because i didn't forewarn you about it i really do apologize uh most sincere youtuber apology ever all right so texas chainsaw massacre have you seen it what did you think about it again if you did i'm sorry whatever you thought comment below let me know and as always if you like what

"""https://youtu.be/rEKWLC5cIhk""",The Munsters,do not ask me why because I won't have an answer for you I won't have a good answer anyway in a world where hundreds of movies all the film that comes out in the course of a year I do videos on a fraction of them today I'm doing a video on this I I gotta admit though with the trailer came out I was like that looks awful I have to so the monsters is written and directed by Rob Zombie who's usually known for his horror Gore Fest he has his dedicated fan base no doubt but generally speaking people seem to agree that his horror movies are passable in the way your dogs bark when you're filming and that I have a lot of friends over and we got chips and popcorn and drinks and it's the month of October we're gonna watch some Horror oh Rob Zombie film right and it seems Rob Zombie so loves the monsters that he was like I'm gonna make a rated PG family comedy it's unexpected now the trailer was terrible I don't know how else to say it the movie lived up to the trailer but the trailer did the film no favors okay but it seems the world heard the cries of the internet thus this Rob Zombie Monsters movie was dumped on Netflix Financial calls like this are are why people question Netflix maybe they were banking on that morbid curiosity factor which admittedly got me I mean here I am I watched it and I'm doing a video on it optimistically I will say there is potential in the world of this monster's movie they all live in Transylvania which kind of reminds me of the Beetlejuice cartoon you're gonna hear the premise and then maybe you can just take that information and allocate it to whatever entertainment you watched that wasn't the Beetlejuice animation you're not as old as I am possibly but you know that ghoulishly endearing world it's a whole Monster World they have their economy then they step into our world and they find our world as weird and scary as we find them the movie is essentially three films in one you have your romantic comedy of Herman Munster and Lily getting together then there's a real estate scam then they buy a house in the real world there's a lot going on in this movie like far more than you would think and I don't think it's going to entertain children as much as Rob Zombie probably wants it to which is funny because Grandpa Munster which I guess his father-in-law monster because not all the monsters are here it being a prequel backstory reimagining Eddie Munster and Marilyn Munster they're not here it's just these three monsters hanging out but he keeps banging on bad comedy in this movie and I I couldn't help but think that's either unironically an amazingly self-aware series of moments or ironically the movie's just not self-aware at all the movie has a color palette that could be fun for kids but the camera works just nauseating it does that Rob Zombie Thing where it's zooming in and out and twisting and turning you could talk about how it represents the off-world off mindset of the monsters like they're from a different plane of existence but it was also annoying in execution that's the thing about this movie there are a lot of Concepts I'm like I get what you were going for but it did not work for this there's a camp and cheese factor in this movie that you can tell is a conscious effort to throw back to the camp and cheese factor of a sitcom from the 1960s it's like a state through my dead glass what an execution This Love Letter fell flat I mean Rob Zombie wrote the movie my first thought was well is he a good comedic writer I know it's a lot of dad jokes and puns there's some play on a situation that I appreciated but again you have to execute it with better comedic timing a lot of it came across as an unfunny SNL sketch or a modern SNL sketch take your pick the two are the same and that comes down to one the writing to the directing and three the casting I get that Rob Zombie's kind of found his crew he likes to work with I don't mean to single out Sherry Moon Zombie and it's not for the sake of being a dick what I'm saying is this film required a lot more from her than the rest of the cast She's inexperienced at leading a comedy so it comes across as awkward I've never cared that Rob Zombie casts her in all of his movies in fact for the two of them I'm sure is pretty [ __ ] cool to make horror movies with the person you love and share your life with it's kind of romantic in a way but when you switch gears in switching the genre over to Comedy both her and Rob Zombie should have known that she wasn't up to the task granted she wasn't up to the task any more than Rob Zombie was up to the task of making a family comedy but either of them are or both should have known that the comedic timings off in terms of the writing and the editing as well the costumes oh my God this movie looked like Spirit Halloween store they were like hey let's just go into the dead corpse and the bones of an old Toys R Us and buy some costumes it looked like costumes to such a degree that there's a scene where they're at this party in this neighborhood this neighborhood's just having a costume Rave for some reason I don't know it seems like it probably was like why didn't I grow up there but these are people in costumes and it looks indistinguishable from the other costumes previously in the movie that are supposed to be actual monsters shout out to Tomas Boykin as Lester first of all the entire makeup budget went to him because that's the best makeup in the movie it has easily not just by a margin by a clear mile the best screen presence and the biggest screen presence in this entire thing and when talking about movies like this when I'm doing my videos I like to come at it from different angles like okay didn't land for me who's it made for well kids obviously kind of no it's a rated PG family comedy it's definitely made for kids but I don't don't see kids laughing at the jokes in here kids don't care about who John Wayne is there's a John Wayne like they don't care they just can't help but think if the poor parents are going to be like oh my God it's on for the kids and the kids are going to be like why is my dad watching this in the end I know Rob Zombie loves the monsters I mean one of his big hits is Dragula a reference to the monsters but this Monster's love letter was more akin to Freddy Got Fingered where you can tell Tom Green was like dude I got all this money for a movie and I'm just gonna make [ __ ] and the Studio's just gonna have to deal with the fact that they gave me this money and that's kind of funny to me so the movie always came across to me anyway I feel like Rob Zombie either did that or this movie's allegory if not a warning where it's like if you take all the offensive comedy out of the world this is the only kind of Comedy that you're gonna have be warned maybe that's what he's trying to say I don't know and I posted a YouTube short about this movie but the story in the YouTube short is true it was midnight I was like oh hey it dropped and I was watching it I was like this has been going on forever and I paused it it was 55 minutes into the movie which is right around the halfway mark it's right there which is another gripe about this movie this movie is way too long hour and a half Max hours 20 minutes would have been better but I was like we're 55 minutes in and watching the rest of the movies another 55 minutes that is the same as pressing start from the beginning and doing everything we've already done all over again that was a horrendous thought so I just turned it off and went to bed finished it today so now I get you this video but it's one of those case and point things I I felt like it was that horrible that I went to bed so obviously sorry Rob Zombie this movie is dog [ __ ] love Hillbilly Deluxe though all right so the monsters by Rob Zombie it's on Netflix now have you seen it what did you think about it did you see it that's a real question but if you did curious to know your thoughts whatever you thought comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click

"""https://youtu.be/f8L5Ha6lZpw""",Bullet Train,all right so you've seen the trailer for this one a lot the movie's finally out so bullet trains directed by david leach it stars brad pitt yes it does but also a lot of other actors comprising a lot of other characters that are very fun and colorful otherwise murderous characters they're hitmen or otherwise people who deal in that kind of a world they've all come together on this bullet train and for the next two hours they're clashing scheming or otherwise navigating through the tangled web that is their lives and their careers and we're all along for the ride simple synopsis yes but it's as accurate as it needs to be and judging from the trailer if i'm just assessing what the trailer looked like the trailer looks like it's john wick meets murder on the orient express with the director of deadpool 2. that's not really the movie the action's in it absolutely is it a stylistic movie without a doubt is the action fun and satisfying as it's going down absolutely it is but i felt like the core of the movie was all these characters traversing the tangled web that is the plot and trying to manipulate and scheme each other to do so and i will say i really loved the characters in the movie because none of the characters really felt like the other characters it's not like you have tough hitman a and tough hitman b and they're kind of interchangeable yeah the actress director the movie it all does a good job at making the characters feel unique and distinct i always like that reminds me of a good jrpg where you're like i have a nice amount of characters and none of them feel like the other ones they're unique tell a movie like this should feel it's shocking how many movies don't pull that off and as much as brad pitt crushes it it's easy to say that he's a standout because he is the main character but he does do a great job in the movie i want to give some special love to brian tyree henry and aaron taylor johnson there's a couple of guys with three names making youtubers get tongue tied they were these standouts in the movie i dare to say when i was having the most fun in here was when they were bantering their banter in their chemistry it is electric in fact if there's a standalone movie with those two i would totally be down i genuinely think that there's a stand-alone spin-off film with those two that i would totally watch also i appreciate the fact this movie does it keeps you guessing you know it's not like one of those moves like i knew where it was going in act one however flip side of that enjoyable coin it's convoluted plot is it convoluted and overly padded sometimes the movie has a style to it too sometimes is it overly stylistic like in a way that you feel like you're you're burning the clock sometimes this movie kind of does throw back to this block of time that i feel like was more brief than some of us remember 2004-2006 like those action crime movies that were super stylistic maybe over the top but it was just kind of it was the point like someone was in high school when they saw pulp fiction or snatch and they were like i'm gonna do that but i'm gonna go crazy definitely as a smoke and aces vibe when i was watching the movies like this kind of reminds me of smoking aces differences smoking aces those those movies i'm talking about from that time they had that grit that late 90s to mid 2000s grit this movie doesn't have that there's no mistake it's like if you watch this movie it's like yeah that was filmed in 2022 for sure regardless there was something that was smoking aces meets the director of deadpool 2. there was a point in the movie where i was like if the movie ended not necessarily ended at this point but ended at this time it would have been perfect about the 90 minute mark and the movie looked like it was wrapping up i was like oh a movie with perfect timing thank wow we have another half an hour oh it's not wrapping up okay granted the last half hour of this movie is batshit it's nuts it's a lot of fun it leaves the audience with that action so i feel like that's where people are coming out of the movie theater like whoa crazy action but i enjoyed the out of that that that was fun guys in the end bullet train it's not like it's not the movie of the year i wanted this to be on my top 10. what can i say amanda wants regardless i felt the movie was a fun time it had colorful characters it kept you guessing when the fights went down those were fun but as you've been listening to this whole video and you didn't skip to the rating because i know you totally didn't do that i guess you didn't if you're listening to this part thank you just know you if you want to see a movie that's a throwback or a love letter to those mid-2000s stylized crime action movies this is that and i walked out of this movie having a fun time no alcohol required funny i feel like i should use the matinee price marcus good time no alcohol required i feel like it's not what it always was before now i'm saying pay these gas prices to get to the movie theater then pay movie theater prizes for the ticket you gotta really want it now but i just thought but i digress there's a bullet train have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to

not just going to talk about a biopic this isn't a common biopic it's it's a cautionary tale so let's talk about it so elvis is a new film it's a biopic directed by baz lerman it's funny because bazlerman films for me they can be hit and miss you know sometimes i'm like i really like the angle the energy i like what he was going for it landed with me other times it kind of falls flat elvis is one of those films that it just the style and what baz luhrmann was going for in execution it really clicked with me first of all the baslerman style the flare you look at the title you're like yeah bash lerman directed that all right and if we take one scene in particular you saw in the trailer when elvis just belts it out you know and he's moving we've seen elvis footage and you know it's easy to see elvis footage like all right that was a big deal back in the day i guess but we're coming from our eyes now you know you know that it's a big deal but there's a difference between knowing and understanding the energy that baz lerman brings to this movie and the scenes where elvis is just moving and all the women are just going crazy in the audience it's like baz lerman takes you to school in that way you know you can have two different teachers for the same subject and one teacher can tell you everything and it just doesn't land and the other teacher just illustrates it to the class in a way where it just clicks that's what vaslerman does with elvis with the energy he brings to the elvis story i think i thought it really worked surprisingly now austin butler plays elvis presley i was kind of concerned not because austin butler i thought he looked great when i saw the trailer elvis usually sounds like an elvis impersonation in the way impersonations sound it's kind of like my arnold schwarzenegger impersonation it's not that honor doesn't sound like this he kind of sounds like this but this is more exaggerated in that animaniacs kind of way you get it right like so i was afraid i was going to hear an impersonation austin butler sounds like elvis presley he sells you on the fact you're like it's just his voice words out scientific advancements austin butler is an elvis presley clone it's one of those roles where by the end you see real footage of elvis in the credits you're like oh he looks different you kind of forget what elvis presley really looks like because you have accepted his elvis as elvis very rarely does an actor actually hit that point with me i thought he was really impressive if his career doesn't explode after this movie i've officially lost a lot more faith in humanity and i already have a couple things the movie does remarkably well is show you the human being behind the legend you know like the legend's still there i mean granted it's a biopic they're gonna dramatize something he's gonna make up gonna bypass some of the other things that maybe they don't want to talk about but i appreciated the fact that we were hanging out with this person elvis presley who didn't ever seem to feel as famous as his legend was to other people out there he was just a guy who wanted to sing sometimes it does play against the film because you're like how much time has gone by years will go by and it doesn't seem like years have gone by there's a part of me that doesn't even want to touch on that in this video because that's that's biopic 101 a constant gripe i have not even gripe just something i address is that it seems like it goes by the ears too fast you know like the passage of time isn't properly illustrated it feels like maybe it's been a month maybe it's been years but you don't really know all you know is elvis went from hey i want to sing too that's a big house and that's just the way biopics generally are now the angle that this movie came at i thought was unique too you know because it's like oh it's a biopic about a famous person that can be kind of cut and paste but having tom hanks narrate at the beginning kind of sets the movie up to be seen through his character colonel tom parker's colonel tom parker's eyes but it illustrates right up the gate that shady is just a word and then there's this guy playing this character who's a real person who really saw himself as the hero of elvis story he just i don't know thought it was birthright like they're in the world they're just they're out there and that's where this movie lands with me this is actually the core of the elvis movie for me it's a cautionary tale because while there is one elvis presley it is easier than ever to become famous now in the information age that we live in which means it's easier than ever for these snakes these scumbags to find you famous people out there on tick tock youtube whatever taking advantage of talented people on the rise has happened since entertainment started and it's not gonna stop anytime soon so i love that this movie uses elvis story to show that very relevant cautionary tale for today and i felt this movie did a good job at doing what i like biopics to do which is make a movie about a famous person about a historical figure about an artist but you don't necessarily make it for people who are already fans elvis fans will have a different relationship with this movie than people who are not elvis fans but you don't have to be an elvis fan to take away something from this movie i mean shoot i went into this movie thinking okay it's gonna be elvis the king of rock and roll vegas what can i say i guess i only knew about the legend of elvis didn't know too much about the darker business side of his life and how it's ever more apparent that among famous people you show me a rich and famous person i'll probably show you someone who's drowning in their sea of sorrow and loneliness anyhow i really dug this movie i was like dude this is a two hour 40 minute movie oh god it's a biopic let's well yours open and what i ended up watching was a story that was remarkably engaging remarkably human and used baz luhrmann's energy to push the film forward at a pace i enjoyed hell yeah it's worth watching and i'll even buy this one on blu-ray all right so elvis like those reviews a bit early and that's that's a good sign too when this screening happens over a week before the movie comes out the embargo is already lifted that's a good sign that the studio has faith the movie's good but in case you're watching this after you already watched the movie have you seen it what did you think about it what's a biopic that you'd like to see maybe it's one that's already been made maybe you'd like it retold whatever it is whatever you think comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more you ,2

was directed by denis villeneuve one of my favorite directors of all time he's made some of my favorite movies of all time the man's a genius and i was extremely excited to see his vision of a movie that's been talked about for a very long time david lynch originally directed an adaptation of this movie and the books are filled with so much lore and so much backstory and so much stuff happening that many people felt a film like this would be very difficult to translate to the big screen dune is a feature adaptation of frank herbert's science fiction novel about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy dune is masterfully directed denis villeneuve is easily one of the best filmmakers working today and he consistently consistently blows you out of the water with incredible visuals the visual effects in arrival and blade runner and now dune have a real depth to them most of the visual effects are aided by the fact that the shot they're in usually has something else in it that we understand the size of whether it's a planet a human being a building that creates this feeling of scope whether it's a sand worm and we're seeing it from the perspective of two people who are on the docking bay of a ship or it's a massive army of people but there's a ship in the sky that's descending towards them the focus is usually on something within the frame that we understand the size of which creates this massive feeling of depth in every single image everything about dune feels otherworldly it feels like you're being transported to a different place the art department outdid themselves the interiors of their homes the interiors of the ships or the places they go underground or this incredible city that they visit everything feels like a living breathing tangible world one of the hardest things about dune though is how much lore there is just how much information a viewer has to understand about this world about things that people can do with certain abilities something called the voice that allows them to influence other people's actions all of this has to be communicated to the audience in a way that feels organic without an overload of exposition or backstory which is very difficult when the source material has so much information and so much depth already but i think they did a really good job of communicating the key elements the things that are most important for the audience to understand so they can relate to these characters and appreciate their journey and their sacrifices when rebecca ferguson's character is teaching her son played by timothy chalamet to use this thing called the voice you immediately understand its power but there's also a long history of politics with different civilizations and they're all sort of warring with each other some actually fighting and some are fighting more in ways that are signatures and treaties and contracts and you can tell they're not really agreeing and there might be some sinister things happening under the surface this is a lot of information and it's understandable why so many people thought that doom is such a difficult thing to translate to the big screen because not everybody really enjoyed david lynch's version and there was also a tv show as well there hasn't been what most people would consider the definitive big screen version of dune i think until now because this movie genuinely is masterful that being said it is incomplete this pretty much the only thing that i could compare dune to halloween kills is that they both feel incomplete this is 100 percent of part one and even though it wasn't really marketed that way it does say dune part 1 in the opening titles and when the film ends you're sort of hanging a little bit there's a lot of things you were looking forward to seeing come to fruition that you're not going to see yet and if the film doesn't do well enough we might not ever see it it's a very strange time we live in where a person who has made great films like enemy prisoners in sandy blade runner 2049 arrival and now dune isn't entirely sure if he can finance dune part two it's such a strange time we live in we live in a time where ridley scott can make a movie with jason bourne batman and kylo ren and it bombs at the box office which i'm going to make a video about that by the way because i saw the film and it's excellent and you should see it too so i hope that we do get a dune part two because i really love this setup and i love real gritty hard sci-fi like this and once again han zimmer out does himself he creates a score here that is somehow very linked to him and sounds like something that he would create but also sounds incredibly unique to what he usually creates i can't wait to listen to it over and over again for years to come timothy chalamet is excellent in this film i think it might actually be my favorite performance of his i also loved oscar isaac rebecca ferguson and josh brolin who once again shows up as a cool guy who's just awesome i don't know why he keeps doing that but he's good at it since this is very much so half a movie zendaya is not in the film that much so if you were really excited to see what she was going to do she's mostly a music video character in the movie because she almost primarily exists in the film as a vision that chalamet's character is having so she's not in the movie all that much and i'm assuming she'll be in part two if they get to make it a lot more i really loved dune the action set pieces were phenomenal but the focus was almost always on the characters to be these massive explosions and ships crashing in the background but you're focused on josh brolin running and i have to say they did an amazing job at setting up so much backstory and so much information and making it feel very digestible for someone who's never read the books or seen david lynch's film or the tv show everything was handled in a way that i think most audiences will be able to understand but denise villeneuve has a way of making big budget movies where a person could see dune and make a movie like say michael bay might have made but his bigger films like blade runner are blockbuster entertainment combined with arthouse and so i don't know if everyone who sees this film is going to appreciate it or if it will make the type of money that a movie like a transformers would make it's a very disappointing world that we live in where these masterful films people are like i'll wait for it to be on streaming which it will be but it's just it's disappointing you know i wish that more people supported films like this because these are the types of movies i want to see more of so guys if you can see dune in theaters i would strongly recommend it as well as the last duel which i'm going to be making a video of i think that's a really damn good movie guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more videos very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized you ,2
"""https://youtu.be/1UvvgS1UpHo""",The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard,the hitman's wife's bodyguard once again stars ryan reynolds and samuel l jackson salma hayek gets a much bigger role this time around and antonio banderas is here to destroy europe i went to the theaters tonight i don't know what else to say michael bryce is now an unlicensed bodyguard and very sad about that and when he runs into darius and sonya kinkade once again he's driven over the edge by their collective insanity i thought the first film was fine i'm surprised there's a sequel but obviously when there's success and you have a-list stars there's going to be more this movie is exactly what you would expect it to be it's another one i don't know but like a lot of sequels you can tell the film exists because they're trying to make more money more than likely if a studio came to the people who make these movies and said we'd like you to make another hitman's bodyguard movie they'd just say okay let's do it whereas if you go to say like john krasinski and say i want to make quiet place three he's probably going to say well give me a while to see if it's even worth it because i want to see if i can make a good movie or a film it's at least as good or better there are sequels and then there are sequels the hitman's wife's bodyguard is a sequel it's just a movie where people run around and antonio banderas is literally trying to upload a virus to destroy europe but i will say there is a place for films like this i mean i really enjoyed going to the theater tonight and i enjoyed mindlessly watching a film that was incredibly stupid and very very lame quite often and if you're going on a date to this movie you'll probably have a good time you'll forget about it instantaneously when you guys go out to dinner afterwards and it won't even register in your brain but you at least escaped from the reality of the real world for maybe 90 minutes and that's where these movies exist hitman's wife's bodyguard has aspirations to do nothing else but that and in that way the film is a success but in virtually every other way it's it's kind of a colossal failure the script is incredibly stupid uh the plot makes no sense at all it's it's very difficult to follow antonio banderas and his luscious voice is basically just there to say random evil things and occasionally threaten people samuel l jackson is very much so on vacation and ryan reynolds is a very likable actor and he does what he does very well in this movie i would say selma hayek does the most interesting stuff actually in the film i liked her quite a bit she's very violent and angry she curses more than samuel l jackson in the movie which is a major thing to say and i would say she's the reason to see the movie if you ever do decide to see the movie that being said it's very clear that in post they either rework things around plot-wise or they realize they didn't address the plot enough because there is so much adr in the middle of action sequences sometimes you can even tell that the characters aren't saying what you're hearing them say just by the way their lips move but there's a lot of cutaways to helicopters or car chases or motorcycles or whatever and you'll hear them blurting out lines that are important plot elements like frank grillo just says antonio banderas is uploading the virus right now to europe he's going to destroy europe and it's he's not even on screen saying that but it's just like a reminder to us things like that happen in the movies all the time and it's not worth mentioning because of how common it is unless it happens like a dozen times or more like in this movie this movie also falls into that trap of having characters that are con artists but not really knowing how to present that in an intriguing way they'll just have characters make insanely dramatic shifts from scene to scene and it's a very cheap way of writing a con artist character you just establish them as one thing in a scene the next scene they're something completely else and there's no nuance to it you can tell the people who made this movie had certain priorities plot and character probably wasn't really one of them catering to its a-list stars that was probably pretty high on their list still despite its incredible stupidity the movie has a few entertaining sequences especially early on establishing ryan reynolds character as someone who no longer wants to be involved in bodyguarding he doesn't want to touch guns he just wants to carry pepper spray he doesn't want to be involved in any of this anymore and so that creates some tension we've seen this done before in movies where you have characters who are known for kind of being a badass who are like no i'm not gonna touch guns anymore uh the rock and the rundown for instance which side note the rundown or welcome to the jungle as it is known in some other places is awesome and you should watch it but still the movie has a pace to it and it's very watchable it's almost calculated in that they know the story in the script can only hold so much weight so they have to make it so fast paced that you don't have time to register how inane everything is and that's basically probably what they're going to do going forward because i can tell they definitely want to make a third one and they might i don't know what they'll title that one but eventually it'll just be this really long title with a bunch of apostrophes i'm going to give the hitman's wife's bodyguard a c-minus this is probably like the most positive spun negative review i've ever done because i went into the movie knowing exactly what i was going to get and it gave it to me i left the theater going yeah that was what i thought it would be never once was bothered by the movie but i couldn't help but notice just it's kind of bad it's just kind of a bad movie but you know it is what it is guys thank you so much as always for watching but i also

"""https://youtu.be/u9qhbsq0suE""",F9: The Fast Saga,f9 is directed by justin lin who made three four five and six this is like the veteran of the fast and furious franchise he's made my favorite one in five and six is also pretty close like he's made my two favorites five and six so in the latest installment cipher enlists the help of jacob dom's younger brother to take revenge on dom and his team which as usual leads them on a merry chase around the globe in really fast cars doing insane things off of bridges and cliffs city streets and some other places too that many people have suggested they might go one day i'm a fan of this franchise look i have the tire collection i get excited for these movies i enjoy watching them they're the right kind of movie you need every once in a while throughout the year a really really stupid mindless film that allows you to just have fun and kind of release yourself from the world's concerns certain installments are better than others and some are very forgettable when it comes to f9 all of these movies have ever so slightly pushed towards absurdity fast five i think is still the best one but even that film had them with their cars and the [ __ ] bank vaults behind them just tumbling down the road and it was so hilarious and funny fast six had a dude kind of flying across the [ __ ] bridge which didn't really make sense so fast nine i think i think they actually lost me on this one like i love absurdity but this movie is is laughable it is 100 a cartoon it's the closest to hilariosity that this franchise has ever gotten it's all skillfully done justin lin is a great director and he's very very good with action set pieces but the dialogue and the characterization and the things that take place in this movie might as well be science fiction it's gotten to a point where i couldn't really believe anything that was happening human beings in this film are bounced around as if they were a pool ball in a pool game they just get knocked all over the place cars often catch human beings from falls which in the beginning of the movie you meet dom and letty's son brian and they have this peaceful life together but then they're brought back into action when tyreese and ludacris show up and they never really explained what they did with brian the whole time like they're far off in the middle of nowhere purposely away from everybody like who's babysitting brian where was he that poor kid was locked in a wooden box this whole movie i know it the things that happen in this movie are absolutely ridiculous and i've come to expect that with these films but the fast movies always sort of rode this line they were just about threatening to sort of teeter into parody but they always were very careful to stay in a somewhat sense of realism where you could watch the film and at least get invested in it without bursting out into laughter every time a human being is thrown 20 stories down into a [ __ ] pool of water with concrete debris flying all over him and then he has a vision and we're supposed to take that seriously which happens in this movie the films were very good at teetering on that line writer chris morgan wrote every single one from two to eight including hobbs and shaw this is the first film that is not including chris morgan since the original fast and the furious and honestly i never realized how much the writer or the fast and furious franchise sort of got it because this doesn't really feel like one it feels kind of like they're imitating one but they're going so far and kind of placating a lot of the internet's wishes and jokes and memes about what fast nefarious could eventually become that i think they took that a little bit too seriously and actually did a lot of it and watching it just kind of took me out of the experience i mean vin diesel is picked up by john cena in this movie and then john cena runs through an open doorway and the back of vin diesel's head crushes the door frame and he doesn't even move he's just he's like a steel wall that smashes through this door frame and he's just like huh what was that he doesn't even react i was like wow and then the same thing happens to this other big dude except he's on top of a [ __ ] truck and behind him comes a large green metal street sign like on a highway and it just plows through his head and he's just like [Laughter] so basically if you go into this movie knowing that it's it's kind of a comedy actually you're gonna have a great time if you want it to be more like the other fast movies i think you might be disappointed by the fact that it's just not and you can tell the filmmakers this time around are very aware of that because they have tyrese theorize throughout the movie whether or not they're invincible ludicrous is like no we're just lucky tyrese is like i think we might be superheroes and he starts naming all the things they've survived and then as you know from the trailers han is magically back as well even though he died and so there's all this like speculation throughout the movie about are they actually just superheroes are they invincible it's i don't know i thought it was kind of dumb honestly i i get that they're being self-aware but i don't know it just kind of took me out of the movie the middle portion of this movie really sags there's a great action sequence early on that was really exciting but having to explain why han is back with this elaborate flashback and all of this talk about some kind of device they're trying to get and then more flashbacks with john cena and vin diesel and what they were doing when they were kids the middle portion of the movie feels like so much setup for the inevitable next film which has to be called fx if they don't call it effects i don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing in a way f9 feels like a setup movie for another movie and that's very disappointing these movies don't really have to do anything except have cool fight scenes and car chases and that's it speaking of fight scenes the inevitable clash between john cena and vin diesel was really weak nothing like the rock versus diesel in an f5 this was like it was like a minute long or something it was kind of [ __ ] actually i was surprised a lot of people know about something that happens in this movie but some of you might not so i'm just going to give a very minor spoiler warning if you don't want to know about the truly crazy thing that happens in the film i'm going to talk about it briefly but i don't really think it's really a spoiler a lot of people are talking about it people are aware of it still just in case you don't want to know anything spoiler warning there's been a meme for the fast and furious movies for like seven years that they should just go to space well they did uh and it's not just like a funny little winking reference to being sort of in the atmosphere like they're straight up in orbit in a car with a rocket i i don't know this one kind of lost me guys i feel like uh i feel like they truly jumped the shark here or or jumped the [ __ ] orbit whatever the new term will be after this movie comes out i'm going to give f9 a c minus this movie will entertain a lot of people especially if you just go into it thinking it's a comedy then i think you'll really have a good time so keep that in your head if you go to see the movie but don't expect it to be like all emotionally like powerful or something it's just they they call it a keystroke the movie is a keystroke guys thank you so much as always for watching

"""https://youtu.be/ww102HHPByo""",Batman: The Long Halloween,batman the long halloween part one is a new animated film from dc coming to blue ray this is based off of the famed graphic novel in which batman investigates a series of murders that only occur on holidays aided by jim gordon and harvey dent they try to identify who the killer is and see if they can stop him whenever a major holiday comes around i don't normally watch all the dc animated films because they vary in quality immensely some are fantastic like flashpoint paradox and some should have been great but just weren't like the killing joke and so i've never really gotten into them that much that being said the long halloween is maybe my favorite comic of all time it's certainly one of mine and i loved it for years and i've always hoped that there would be a film adaptation of it granted i was hoping for a live action adaptation but still i wanted to see if dc could pull it off they have changed their animation style i think for the better they're using thicker lines now everything seems deeper and darker and it looks far better than it used to in fact so much better i don't really understand why they weren't just doing this from the first place so immediately one of my biggest issues with a lot of the dc animated films was solved within the first few frames because you can tell they have put a lot of work into this animation not that they weren't before it's just that there was a certain kind of tv quality to the way some of those movies looked and not even as good as the original animated series this film looks much better although there are a few things that i noticed about the animation that i'll talk about in a second but of course the thing i was most concerned about was the story are they gonna do it justice now naturally this is half of a story sometimes that can be incredibly annoying but in the case of this graphic novel that is so sprawling and so filled with information and and detail it makes sense that they would spread it into two films with something like the killing joke which was a fairly short story they were straining to make a feature film out of that and they added so much unnecessary things especially early on this film takes its time with the story in fact certain scenes play out slower than perhaps you might think they should even at 85 minutes or so however long this movie is there are some scenes that especially when it comes to dialogue there seems to be a lot of unnecessary pauses a bit too many beats taken in between sentences and that could just be the editing but you can tell they're trying to draw things out and it works to create an aura of suspense and tension around these killings but there was a sense to the edit where it just felt like it was a bit too slow and i'm not talking about pacing i'm just talking about sometimes shots are on screen for too long but my nitpicks aside i would say they did the story justice so far anyway i've only seen half of it they did a fairly good job at recreating that while also adding some things that in some cases actually improved upon it for instance in the comic batman has this scuffle with catwoman early on and in the comic it's a few panels in the film they have an extended chase sequence on top of a train and over many rooftops and it was quite thrilling in the comics sometimes jim gordon will hint that harvey dent might be having some problems at home with gilda his wife and you don't always see those problems in the film you do you see a lot more of the drama that's going on with those characters at home so where a comic can be kind of beautifully tight and everything is just really contained and you only get the needed information that you truly truly need to understand what's going on amongst beautiful artwork a film can sometimes take those panels and really expand upon them sometimes not for the better in the case of this movie i think they actually did a really good job at bringing just a little more depth to an already great story as i already mentioned when you cut something into two parts especially when it comes to a movie historically that's gone very poorly you always go into part one knowing you're not going to be fully satisfied you're only going to get little bits and pieces but with this film and the upcoming one which obviously i have not seen yet they're coming out in such a quick time period that it doesn't really leave you it's almost like a tv show really like you have the one episode and you have a cliffhanger and you'll get the resolution soon enough it's not like you have to wait a year and like i said it does make sense that they're taking their time with such a sprawling comic book it's got a lot of detail and vitality in it and so i like that they're not just trying to cram it all into one film interestingly this one's pg-13 and the next one has been rated r so i'm assuming there's gonna be some bloody  going on and i'm i'm looking forward to that hopefully it's actually legitimately rated r and not just like the way these animated movies have randomly been rated r lately where there's like one shot that's kind of bloody and then nothing else and it's like why is this rated r this kind of used to be pg when i was a kid i was happy with the way they treated the story but i also think that someone who's never read the comic can still be entertained by this you don't have to have read the comic to understand this story there are clearly some scenes that have been added to kind of beef up the action nature of the film and give it a little more of a fun vibe but it's dark it's violent the characters that need to be tragic are falcone's son that he hates and doesn't give any respect is an incredibly sad character and they do a great job bringing that to life but i mentioned earlier that i would circle back to the animation because there is one thing i want to pinpoint i understand that things are not done exactly the same way as they used to i love to watch cartoons and animations from the 80s and 90s and you can see imperfections on the screen within the cells of the animation all of that adds something to it i believe nowadays most of it is done in the computer and there's an attempt to create something in the computer that looks like it was hand drawn and you're never going to fully get that experience there's a reason why all of haney miyazaki's movies are so gorgeous is because he's got the pencil grit underneath his fingernails you know like he's doing it himself when it comes to this movie there are specific character animations you know of like them moving their hands while they talk where you could really tell that their bodies were shifted in certain moments while they were speaking and only while they were speaking and it creates sort of a robotic unnatural sense to the way the people move we were so close we were so close jim he was ready to sing and not just about carmine the whole family was going away we had a real opportunity to change things we still do it's just a setback we'll find another way to take down falcone together to be clear this isn't for the whole movie it's just for a few scenes a handful of scenes and it's possible that maybe they just didn't have the time they needed to finish some of those scenes that is often the case i was talking to a friend of mine who's just a genius with visual effects and the common complaint is usually that they just don't have enough time almost every visual effects artist wants to get their work to a place where it's perfect and where nobody will ever say what i just said about the movement of their arms or whatever like a little on youtube but for all of them they they don't always have that time when they're under a deadline and they have to finish when they finish or maybe they thought it looked good and it kind of doesn't you know that could always happen too nitpicks aside most of my worries were calmed by watching part one there's no super unnecessary stuff there's some added things but i think for someone who had never read the comic that's gonna work just fine i think they did a really good job actually setting up part two and i'm hoping that part two is just a little bit better paced i'm gonna give part one a b guys thank you so much as always for watching as soon as part two comes out i'll check it out and have a review for you guys as always you're the best thank you once again and if you like this you can click right here and get

monster they're able to disguise themselves as humans and they venture to a small town on the italian riviera to enter a vespa race so i'm not going to get into spoilers of course but like if you just so happen to not know anything about this movie like i did going in i will talk about certain plot developments early on that i didn't know were in the film and so if you really just want to go in completely blind or if you've seen the trailer already you're probably going to be fine as usual with every pixar movie this thing looks amazing and it sounds amazing the voice work is top-notch everyone's really good in the movie and it has really valuable lessons for young kids especially when it comes to not hiding who you really are not being ashamed of who you really are and sharing that with people despite what they may think and it's realistic in that it takes the approach that maybe not everybody's going to like that and there's nothing you can do about that and sometimes you just have to take the best you can get there's some really great messages in lucca but unfortunately it's easily one of the lesser pixar films for me for me this is more in line with a film like say the good dinosaur all my issues with the film are entirely story it has nothing to do with the technical prowess on display or the actors it's the story first off i don't really understand what luca does under the sea the film begins with him sort of leading around some mindless fish as a sea monster he has a personality so does his family they all have lives and they can talk but i don't really understand what it is they do i understand that they're afraid of humans they're afraid of being killed or being found but when luca walks out of the ocean into the fresh air and meets alberto he changes into a human being the film makes no attempt to really explain this transformation why it happens why water turns them back into a sea monster and why on land they don't look like a sea monster there certainly could be attributed a deeper meaning to this transformation than perhaps the film wants to go into but for the most part you don't really know what luca does underwater and once he meets alberto who's also a sea monster alberto has a sort of warped view of what the world is really like he thinks the stars are called fish he blurts out italian has no idea what he's saying he's just repeating things that he's heard he has a poster of a vespa scooter and so he believes that a vespa scooter is like all you have to get in life it's what everyone should be dreaming about and so that becomes their entire goal for the first half of the movie it's a literal fish out of water story and so you're watching characters that are very clueless and they don't know anything which made it difficult for me to get invested in the story it felt very aimless which i believe was the point it's sort of supposed to be this wondrous summer where you're coming of age you're discovering things about yourself but it doesn't really feel like anything of merit is going on the other issue i had with the movie were the stakes they're very low obviously being discovered that he's really a sea monster is a problem if it rains that's going to be an issue if somebody splashes water on him that's going to be an issue it's kind of like ranma one half a great anime if you've never seen it but a character in that show transforms from boy to girl if they're splashed with water and this film may or may not have been inspired by that but it's clearly inspired by hayao miyazaki's films the town is called porto russo for instance but again going back to the stakes yes people might find out that he's a sea monster and get upset or try to kill him but his parents are also searching for him in this town because they're upset that he went out of water on land and they're trying to hide their sea monsters as well but they're also taking every kid they find in public and dumping them in water to see if it's their kid or not which is funny but at the same time are they trying to like publicly out their kid as being a sea monster in front of everybody because that might be an issue since they're trying to stay in hiding so maybe i'm thinking too deeply into this but this is the kind of stuff that i would have been asking the writers when they were developing this story the film picks up a bit once they meet a young girl in town who helps them train and learn how to ride a vespa and enter into this race but there's also an incredibly cheesy and over-the-top villain who's the best vespa scooter racer in the entire town and he just walks around being an to everybody and it's easily one of pixar's lamest villains in a long time i think i would have enjoyed luca more if i knew anything about luca's world before he was thrust into a new one we learned so little about what he does all day and we know nothing about his transformation abilities we it's just sort of established that a sea monster is a sea monster in the ocean and looks like a human on land and i just wish i knew more about the world and the aimless nature of the film really didn't help anything either i may be in the minority and saying this a lot of people might really enjoy luca but this one wasn't for me it just wasn't at pixar's greatest heights and i'm just i'm not seeing this leaving a lasting impact like most of pixar's movies i'm gonna give luca a c guys thank you so much as always for watching but i also want to give a big thank you to the sponsor for this video policy genius if

"""https://youtu.be/Bbq2k0aRVTQ""",Censor,sensor is a new indie horror film from first time feature director prano bailey bond she previously directed the short nasty which no doubt inspired this film so after viewing a strangely familiar video nasty enid a film sensor sets out to solve the past mystery of her sister's disappearance embarking on a quest that dissolves the line between fiction and reality so if you don't know what a video nasty is essentially there was an influx of extremely violent and lurid films that were shared on video cassette mostly in the 1980s and a lot of them were able to bypass the ratings boards and they were kind of underground people watched some really [ __ ] up stuff and it caused quite the public fervor and this film takes place in that time period where we have someone who is trying to decide what needs to be cut out of a movie to obtain a certain kind of rating she watches incredibly gory violent and inappropriately sexual things all day to try to figure out what rating a film should get films like this have almost become their own sub-genre you have blowout the great brian de palma film with john travolta he records sounds for movies and he's working on horror films or there's barbarian sound studio with toby jones which is also about a sound engineer's work on an italian horror film but a plot like this is obviously ripe for horror someone is forced to watch the most [ __ ] up things all day the kinds of stuff that we normally don't see in a movie because somebody like the woman in the film said you have to cut that out otherwise it can't be released with a rating she's essentially alex from a clockwork orange except she's paid to do it and she kind of enjoys it i had a great time with this movie and it wasn't just because i got to see it in a theater which was amazing i thought this was extremely well directed especially for a first timer but also the created video nasties they made for the movie are really great and kind of nostalgic if you ever watched any of the old ones they did a fantastic job recreating the feel of those but it never loses sight of what it is which is essentially a character study this is a movie about someone who is deeply obsessed with something and a lot of people think they're kind of insane for continuing to be obsessed with it sometimes the film can get a little uneven because it's trying to balance that the fact that she is looking for her sister but also there's this sort of mystery that's developing with one of the video nasty she watches and a filmmaker that might just be killing people in them for real and that's definitely the more interesting part of the film unfortunately the search for her sister can sometimes feel like it's on the back burner and not exactly the primary focus and when the two kind of converge i could see some people being disappointed in the finale there are aspects of it that are going to be polarizing for sure but i thought it was fairly ambitious the way she melded those two stories together without getting into spoilers having people appear in the video nasty that maybe aren't there and you're sort of experiencing it through someone's pov and and they might be not entirely reliable and i think that's very frightening the movie goes to some very deep dark places when it comes to horror and it's wonderfully acted all the way through the film does owe a lot to those other films that i mentioned but it's also clearly very inspired by videodrome david cronenberg's film which was also an exploration of what violence in movies could do to people in the 1980s and this film also has a body horror scene that very much so reminded me of some iconic imagery from video drums so it's not that the film's entirely original it's just that it has a unique presentation and a clear clear focus on character and something else the film does very well that's really hard to pull off is allow its main character to make choices that you don't necessarily agree with you don't really condone what she's doing but you kind of are okay with it when you have movies where characters are in life or death scenarios and they're trying to survive and they keep doing stupid things it can get very annoying and you can check out from the movie and it can just lose you because you're not following the choices the characters are making this film achieves a very difficult balancing act of showing a character make choices that aren't really good choices but because you can understand the state of her mind and how she's becoming increasingly more unhinged you kind of go with it and you're okay with some of those choices that you might not normally be okay with and that's really hard to accomplish sensor definitely owes a lot to other films of the 1980s but i think it's a really really original vision and i can't wait to see what else this director does i'm gonna give censor a b guys thank you so much

"""https://youtu.be/ijrTHm4vuRs""",The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,the conjuring the devil made me do it is the first film in the franchise to not be directed by james wan this one's directed by michael chaves who last made the curse of la yorona just like the previous two conjuring films this movie takes a real case file from ed and lorraine warren played by patrick wilson and vera farmiga and takes a based on a true story approach to it of course with all the trappings of a horror film this one being the very famous the devil made me do it case which was the first time that someone who was on trial for murder pleaded not guilty by means of demonic possession and this film follows ed and lorraine warren as they encounter the entity that may or may not have been responsible for the murder i love the conjuring movies the first two are great i saw an article recently that called the conjuring films the fast food of horror cinema if that's the case let me have a triple goddamn quarter pounder of the conjuring movies because that's exactly the kind of [ __ ] i like to see in the theater if a movie is good it's good i don't care what audience it's aimed at i don't care if it's high concept horror or elevated horror which is a term i'm not a huge fan of i just love it all when it comes to the conjuring 3 there's a lot to like patrick wilson and vera farmiga being the utmost of all of those things they're fantastic as always they're the reason i like these movies i mean obviously james wan in his first two films he's so so talented and his scares are so well done and he did such a great job with those first two films no doubt but it's really the human story behind the warrens and the way those characters are incorporated throughout each one of these films that makes them all very entertaining for me i've said this before but it's like a great tv show when you have characters that you really care about you're going to probably enjoy even some of the lesser episodes just because you love the characters and you want to know what they're going to do you want to go on that journey with them and when it comes to the conjuring 3 it is the lesser of the trilogy it's the weakest i think it's not a gargantuan step down it's just that you can feel that it's not quite as refined as the first two james wan is a master behind the camera at this point he's done everything and he's done it all well he's made gritty action with death sentence obviously tons of great horror and he somehow made aquaman work as a feature he's a great masterful filmmaker as far as i'm concerned but michael chaves is also a very good director this film is much better than la yorona it has a lot of really well crafted scares it's a gorgeous looking movie everyone is very good in it the performances are strong at first rate and there are some very good sustained sequences of tension it's just that the story isn't quite as good as the first two part of that is because it feels like these movies all kind of have to relate to some sort of horrific case that we've heard of before and in so doing it's sort of trapped in that and they can't really get out of that and so obviously we've all heard of the devil made me do it case if you've ever researched the paranormal or anything like that on the internet i'm sure you've heard of it and so this film obviously explores that but they can't make an entire film about just one incident that's very horrific and so sometimes the story feels like it's being held back by the fact that they have to make it about a certain case but the case itself is only slightly interesting in one specific way and they have to also fill the movie with other things and so sometimes they get away from the devil made me do it case and kind of build their own mythology around it and honestly i really enjoyed it one good thing they did throughout the movie with the characters was that from pretty much the opening scene patrick wilson's character ed warren has a heart attack and throughout the entire film this health issue that he's dealing with is a constant source of tension the stakes are always high for him even a brisk jog through the woods could end up in the hospital and so that's a lot to be dealing with when you're [ __ ] with a demon and so they also did a good job with the stakes for lorraine because she's feeling a connection with this entity and the entity may or may not be forcing her or the people around her even her loved ones to do things that they don't want to do and so the film has a lot of opportunities to take the characters in different directions and make them do shocking things to one another that they normally would never have done it's also just very well paced there's rarely a boring scene even when you can kind of tell that it's not necessarily as interesting or as compelling as the first two it's never boring it's always investing and i cared about what was going on there's also a great supporting turn from the actor john noble a lot of these kinds of movies have an expert that you visit and they have some sort of knowledge about something that the lead characters need to know about he plays that character but it's a little deeper than that and he gets a lot of opportunities to really flex his chops he's damn good in the movie and extremely creepy the film isn't quite as scary as the first two but there are a few sequences that really stand out to me one in a morgue that i think is really [ __ ] great there's a wonderful underground tunnel sequence that i think is really strong for the most part though it's the least scary of the three there's a slight over reliance on the typical build up to a jump scare you know something's coming you're waiting for it to come and then it does and you're sort of released the tension's gone now from the moment and that's something all these movies do and james juan is particularly great at it because none of his scares are false and he has a good way of subverting your expectations for what you expect the scare to be and then saying actually no it's over here this film does that a few times just not as well as juan does and it's impossible to not think about that while you're watching it nevertheless these movies i get excited about all of them i was really excited to watch this and it was good i really did have a good time with it and most of it is because of those characters patrick wilson and vera farmiga are excellent as these roles and just like a great tv show i will watch these characters do things even when the episodes aren't as good as some of the others i'm gonna give the conjuring the devil made me do it a b it's gonna be in theaters and hbo max very soon so please do check it out i think it's worth your time especially if you're a horror fan but just go in knowing it's probably not as good as the other two but certainly not a bad film guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized you ,1
"""https://youtu.be/jWcpS8s0Rdk""",Cruella,cruella's directed by craig jalepsi the man behind i tonya and lars and the real girl a movie you should see if you've never seen it it's so weird and i love it the film is set in 1970s london amidst the punk rock revolution and it follows a young grifter named estella played by emma stone she dreams of being a fashion designer but she spends her days being a petty thief but when estella's flair for fashion catches the eye of baroness von hellman played by emma thompson a fashion legend their relationship sets in motion a course of events that will lead estella to embrace her wicked side and become cruella deville look i'm going to be completely blunt i didn't care about this movie at all i didn't want to see it i'm kind of done with disney live action stuff so many of them have been bad to mediocre a couple of them are okay and some of them are actually kind of good but i just can't get excited for them anymore i just i can't look forward to them anymore and i don't know if it's because i'm becoming some old crusty sack or maybe they've just mostly been kind of bad lately especially mulan and i knew nothing about the film i thought it was rated pg it's not it's pg-13 i thought it was a super family movie it's not it's got some dark [ __ ] in there i just thought it was yet another disney property ip and yeah sure it is you know they're gonna probably make more if this is successful but craig gillepsi directs with a considerable amount of energy sometimes too much energy actually sometimes the scenes move too quickly and it feels like he could have waited a little bit longer but i mean the movie is already over two hours long so i understand why it's as quick as it is but the film moves surprisingly well and it doesn't feel like any other disney films to me i mean of course i mean i'm not like extremely well versed in every movie they've ever released but it felt more like the devil wears prada with a darker tinge to it and i really like the devil wears prada and so i appreciated that this movie seemed like it was taking a few risks in that it does have some very dark stuff there are some scenes that would greatly bother children there's death in it and there's a considerable amount of implied violence and i know that a lot of parents will probably not like a few scenes in the movie but i thought they were [ __ ] cool emma stone is good as corella i liked her quite a bit i had to get away from the fact that i always associate glenn close with this character from live action but she's very good in the film i guess glenn close is actually a producer on the movie which is kind of cool but really the star of this movie and the person who steals every scene she's in is emma thompson i can imagine that having both of your leads named emma was probably a little annoying on set but she's amazing in the film she's one of the best disney villains in a long time she is a ruthless relentless absolutely horrible human being the stuff that she does and that it's implied that she has done is [ __ ] up and what worked so well about the movie for me was the mentor-student relationship between young estella and baroness von hellman the desperation in estella trying to please her trying to impress her with her designs and ideas for fashion it's something that really anyone can relate to if you want to create something and you're trying to impress people who are in positions of power that you feel you need to impress to do what you want to do for a living and the twists and turns the movie takes uh some of them i expected absolutely 100 there's a few things where i'm like of course yeah obviously but there was one thing that honestly i did not expect and i should have seen it coming but i didn't so that's good i mean the movie had a pace to it that was infectious the costume design is also beautiful and there are some things that i am just always going to notice they're always going to trigger something in me a memory of some kind that i'm always going to pay attention to and one of those things is when golden eye sound effects or sound effects that were used in goldeneye 64 are in movies and there is absolutely 100 a gasp from a female character when she's tased in this film that is definitely this every time they use a sound effect that was in golden eye in a movie i'm going to point it out without a doubt the thing about the film that bothered me the most is its incredibly aggressive soundtrack all the songs are obviously hit songs from the 70s but it's almost constant it reminded me of suicide squad where songs were very heavily relied on to create a feel when at times the movie really didn't need to revert to a song but there are so many uses of classic songs from the era and it started to grate on my nerves a little bit because i felt like the movie was overly relying on that it wasn't really creating its own tone or own feel sometimes and just hoping the songs would do all the heavy lifting and there are plenty of things in the movie that i could see disney purists getting upset about people who think that it has to lead into the animation in a specific way or like something that she did in the cartoon has to be reflected here or they change the thing or they switch something around and i don't like how they did that i can see that people who who really want things to all stay the same and don't want to see anything new i could see them getting upset by that and with every disney movie there's always that part of me that's like oh yeah they're setting up something there and and that didn't really need to be in the movie but they just shoehorn that [ __ ] in just for the sequels and for the ip and there's always going to be parts of me that notice those things but it happens man i mean that's how a lot of these things get made you have to kind of convince someone else that there's potential for more development and it's really hard to do that sometimes when you're trying to focus on making just one good movie you can almost tell like oh that's where somebody told jalepsi to put a scene in he probably didn't want to do that but that's in there now because he had to i don't know of course i don't know if that's true but there's just certain moments that feel like they're there because somebody told them to put it there but this movie surprised me i mean maybe it's because i had the lowest of the low expectations and i just didn't really care to see the movie at all and i'm actually gonna recommend it i think you guys should see it um it's gonna be on disney plus i believe i don't know if they're doing that premiere thing or whatever but also in theaters it's a gorgeous looking movie so it'd probably look amazing on the big screen i'm gonna give cruella a b-minus guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon but i also want to give a big thank you to the sponsor

"""https://youtu.be/ktiicnJfUt4""",A Quiet Place Part II,a quiet place part two is directed by john krasinski once again just like the first one except this time he has soul writing credit last time he shared that credit with beck and woods this time it's all krazynski now before i say the plot i will say that if you have not yet seen the first quiet place you'll probably get some spoilers for that movie because this movie picks up exactly where that film leaves off so if you have not yet seen that film that's your warning following the events at home the abbott family led by emily blunt now face the terrors of the outside world forced to venture into the unknown they realize the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sand path the first quiet place was so good it has become the go-to reference whenever anyone talks about high concept horror anytime i've ever tried to pitch something that i've written to a producer or to a executive or to a studio quiet place inevitably will get brought up at some point during the conversation and so to make a sequel to that i can imagine was a daunting task and i thought this film was excellent the first film was very tense and very suspenseful all throughout the concept of monsters that hunt by sound and you have to be very quiet was a genius idea for a horror film and that's executed once again extremely well here and it's similar to the first in that it is very simple the characters have to go to a place and get a thing some people are trying to go to another place and get a thing and that's really all you need for a film like this it's so execution based and it's entirely about tension and krazynski pulls off what i think is one of the better horror sequels i've ever seen i think it's really really good i loved everything about the film this is exactly the kind of movie that i wanted it to be and it surprised me it gave me ideas i i didn't expect uh the performances were once again magnificent emily blunt can do no wrong but millicent simmons and noah jupe are both fantastic especially simmons in a very featured role and i only watched the teaser for the movie so i didn't realize that killian murphy was going to have a substantial role i knew he was in the movie but he gets a lot in this movie like he's a front and center character and i love him and he's phenomenal everyone is and one of the biggest reasons the actors are so great in both of these movies is because they rely so much on silent communication and visual storytelling and so that's like meat and potatoes for an actor to not have to communicate everything through dialogue and just simply have looks sign language and and body language and that kind of thing can be very exciting for a great actor and they're all so so good in the film but honestly the star of this film is krazynski this is a masterfully directed movie he should be incredibly incredibly happy with this film this was shot in 35 millimeter film and you can [ __ ] tell every frame of this movie looks like the kind of films that excited me when i was a kid if i had seen this when i was 13 it would have been one of those movies that made me want to go out in my backyard with the camera and make films tight compact scenes that start right when they should and end right when they should the suspense is always at a high and character is always favored with the monster action happening around them he doesn't treat the monsters like their spectacle he always frames the spectacle within the same image as his characters very rarely does he just cut to like epic shots of destruction or anything like that if there is things like that in the film and there are the characters are always in the foreground the characters are the focus when it comes to horror movies that pick up right where the last one left off i always think of halloween 2 the original more of the night he came home and if they can pull that off then you have this great double feature you can always have in the future and quiet place one and two back to back are going to be like the greatest three hour suspense movie i'm so satisfied with krazynski's work here the opening sequence is easily one of my favorite openings in a horror film ever i talked about this in my original review of quiet place and i don't really consider this a spoiler because it is in every single trailer showing day one of this event would be a completely different film it would be mass hysteria whereas cutting to much later you allow the characters to understand the world and they know how to survive and they kind of get the rules now this film's opening sequence is day one and it's [ __ ] riveting krazynski please continue to make films it just i mean do whatever you want but you gotta make more movies like this man this was everything i wanted it to be i was so satisfied with the character work the suspense is always really white-knuckled the monsters are amazing again he he shows them you know what they look like but the characters are always in the forefront if i really truly had to pick my brain and be annoyed with myself for thinking this deeply about a film's potential flaws the only thing i can really think of is that the ending of the film which i quite like is not necessarily as emotionally resonant as the ending of the first um that's all i can come up with this film gave me everything i wanted if you love the first you're gonna love this one too i'm gonna give a quiet place too and a god watching this movie i i really felt like okay this is a theater experience this is something that i am so glad i got to see in a theater it was very smart for them to hold off and not release this during covid seeing it in the theater tonight was worth the wait if you get a chance to see in the theater i would highly highly suggest that guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and

"""https://youtu.be/G0wX3WJHOHs""",Army of the Dead,army of the dead is directed by zack snyder and this is his return to the horror genre after dawn of the dead in 2004 which is a film of his i really enjoy after a zombie outbreak in las vegas a group of mercenaries led by dave bautista take the ultimate gamble venturing into the quarantine zone to pull off the greatest heist ever attempted now that movie theaters are starting to open again and some folks are choosing to go out and see a film i've been wanting to see a film that i can just relax sit back enjoy have a giant tub of popcorn and kind of forget about everything and we don't get that many of those movies anymore a lot of things want to be very serious and remind us of the world that we live in and so i was very much hoping that zack snyder's army of the dead would do that for me and it did this movie was an absolute blast i had such a good time with this movie just the opening credits scene alone is phenomenal i feel like the opening credits of the movie deserve to be considered for future list of best opening credits of all time and zack snyder's name is all over those credits not only did he take part in the screenplay the producing and obviously the directing he's a director of photography he's a cinematographer for the whole movie there are instances throughout the movie where he overuses very shallow focus characters walk away out of focus he doesn't pull focus with him he just lets it stay soft the whole time it's a type of thing that i wouldn't really reference but it happens a lot and for some people that could get really annoying it's not like it took me out of the movie that much i just started to notice how often he does it what i really liked about this movie is that it combines a lot of different kinds of zombies you have your classic george a romero zombies that are pounding against the cabin wall and they're very slow and they're kind of stupid you have your danny boyle 28 days later zombies that are running at you really fast and they're just gonna tear out your [ __ ] jugular but there's also zombies in the film that are very smart they call them alpha zombies they're in control of the others those zombies listen to them because this place is basically like a john carpenter's escape from new york kingdom for these zombies they have leaders they have ranks and that was really interesting just to see the whole mythology that he crafted behind this las vegas outbreak i also liked dave bautista in the movie quite a bit i think this movie really showcases his range because i love him in guardians as drax but he does have a surprising amount of range as an actor and he's really damn good in the movie it's also surprisingly very funny there were a lot of jokes that really hit for me where the film falters a little bit is in its very bloated run time the movie does not have to be two and a half hours a lot of zack snyder films are a little bit too long i could easily see about 15 minutes of this movie being cut out there's scenes that sometimes go a few frames longer than they really need to be the pace could be tightened just ever so much there's a few times where it feels like information you're getting just isn't important and the scene could just end there's also times where snyder goes for something that's very surprising but it also creates a disservice to the characters that he sets up there are some scenes where you feel very invested in what could potentially happen for two characters and their future and he throws something in there at the last second that is dramatic and it creates a slow-motion sequence with somebody screaming and their voice echoes and it gets murky and it reverberates and you get a song that you might not expect to be in a zombie movie which is a very zack snyder thing that he likes to do so at times he will sacrifice interesting character for shock value and for some that will really work you might like the surprise of something unexpected happening but i was a little let down that i was getting invested in characters that he was setting up and then suddenly he doesn't seem to care about the future of those characters and i didn't love how he chose to end the film it feels like the movie has a definitive ending and then there's like 10 more minutes again that's something that snyder has done in the past but honestly i just had a really good time watching this movie i felt like i was in a real movie again do you know what i mean like just in the theater there was only like five people there uh but still like this big giant screen popcorn it just everything felt right and the little nitpicks that i have about the movie it didn't stop me from having a great time i'm going to give army of the dead a b if you feel comfortable going to a movie right now it isn't theaters if you don't it's going to be on netflix really soon either way i think you should check it out especially if you like his dawn of the dead movie guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized you ,1
"""https://youtu.be/F9nVjpER_wA""",Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train,[Applause] demon slayer the movie mugen train is finally released in american theaters this was the highest grossing film of all time in japan it was a massive massive success demon slayer is one of my favorite new anime of the past few years i love the storytelling i love the characters the animation is gorgeous and it's a lot of fun and super bloody and has a lot of great horror to it so it's right up my alley and the movie picks up exactly where the show leaves off so i'll try not to ruin any details about the show just in case you haven't seen it the film absolutely positively is not standalone knowing things about the show having seen the show is going to improve your experience significantly you really do kind of have to have seen the show yeah you can watch it and sort of get a feel of what's going on but it's really going to help if you've seen the show but the basic gist of the plot is that after his family was brutally murdered and his sister turned into a demon tanjiro and his comrades embark on a new mission aboard the mugen train on track to despair on this train tanjiro and his pals get help from rengoku an extremely powerful hashira someone they really look up to as a demon is taking control of the train and the passengers on it trying to infiltrate their dreams and keep them in a dream state so we can kill them my wife and i and most of my friends have really been looking forward to this as i've already stated demon slayer is a really good anime i really love it i had a great time with it and the movie does not disappoint if you love the show you're going to love this movie as i already stated you do have to sort of have a knowledge of the show to truly appreciate this movie and if you don't it might be harder to like it this film gave me just about everything i wanted to see as a fan of the show and it's also rare in that it's an anime film based off a tv show that is actually canon that is actually a sequel most of these anime movies that happen out of shows we love tend to just be these sort of offshoots and one-offs where they don't really impact the show's narrative which can be fun for the movie but it always feels strange when you jump back into the show and you have to remind yourself the things you just saw don't really matter i like that they matter here tanjiro's experiences on this train are very important because as this demon puts him to sleep and puts him in a memory that he would prefer to live where his family are alive and he can spend time with nezuko his sister as a human and she doesn't have to wear a bamboo brace around her mouth and she's not a demon anymore and he can be with his family again and he has to force himself to realize that he's in a fantasy and get out of that fantasy and go back to the real world which is a much harsher place where people die and where he can be hurt and he has to learn to accept that and sort of throw away the past that has meant so much to him but is also holding him back in a way so it's important to his character development although the movie is very action-centric and sometimes comedy centered and the character development is a little minimal at times i like the fact that this movie is going to actually impact demon slayer as it moves forward and especially his experiences with ren goku rengoku is awesome in this film he's a [ __ ] badass and you understand why everyone looks up to him i just have to say the most obvious thing though this animation is [ __ ] spectacular it's some of the best i've ever seen in the anime film it kind of blew me away and dragon ball broly looked great the most recent my hero academia film looked amazing the animation is so top tier that it's hard to imagine it being better than this it's so so good and the fight sequences really popped off the screen the score was really epic and i got into all the fights the the comedy hit really well especially a sequence inside zanetsu's subconscious where he's forced to deal with a man who's infiltrated his subconscious which is very hard for him because he's very much so in love with women and that sequence was [ __ ] hilarious i i thought it was really funny that character can sometimes get on my nerves screams quite a bit sometimes way too much i think they found a pretty good balance of it here where he was terrified and screaming and crying for the right amount of time without getting on my nerves as much as he did in the show there are a couple things about the film that i wished were slightly different neziko unfortunately doesn't do much in the film she might be my favorite character of the whole show even though she doesn't really say much i just really like nezuko and i wish that she was more involved in the movie she has one great moment but then it's kind of undercut by having to be rescued which i thought was kind of cheap and also without getting into any spoilers someone kind of just appears near the third act to sort of create a development and it didn't feel like there was much setup to it at all what transpires after said appearance was extremely entertaining but i wish that there was more of a setup for why that person is there beyond that you know honestly i just had a great [ __ ] time watching this movie my friends and i and my wife we we had such a blast with it it gave me what i needed it was extremely entertaining as a demon slayer fan a lot of the character stuff was very funny i just wish that there was a little more nezuko and a slightly more polished narrative in regards to who appears it is very much so part of the show it's a movie that you can watch as a film that's entertaining if you if you know the show it will be best enjoyed if you just watched episode 26 of season one if you're kind of just popping it in uh years to come it might feel sort of cut out of time and not necessarily its own thing but if you're watching it right after season one it's just gonna feel like more of what you love i'm gonna give demon slayer the movie an a minus i had a great time with this and i'm assuming that if you're a fan of the show you probably will as well it is in theaters now i hope you guys get a chance to see it if it's safe and you feel comfortable doing so thank you guys as always for watching and if you like

"""https://youtu.be/6XA6jnb4--w""",Mortal Kombat,mortal kombat has finally arrived this film has been in development for a very long time we had the original mortal kombat back in what 95. paul w s anderson then a sequel mortal kombat annihilation which was an absolute abomination against humanity and so funny i love watching that movie oh my god as long as i have the power khan you will never rule this world as long as the portal remains open your world becomes my world but all these years later we have a new adaptation of the film that's rated r and very bloody and very violent this film tells the story of mma fighter cole young who seeks out earth's greatest champions in order to stand against the enemies of outworld in a high-stakes battle for the universe when it comes to the mortal kombat games my friends and i always enjoyed kicking each other's asses in them but i never really got into the story i know there's a lot of story to mortal kombat never really interested me i liked ripping people's spines out what can i say that's about it so that's really all i wanted from this movie i wanted really bloody brutal epic fights that felt weighty that had impact to them it was rated r and that's what was promised me the first like 10 minutes of the movie i was like holy [ __ ] this is like way better than i thought it was going to be because my friend and i we were just gonna we actually made popcorn and we were just going to like watch this and and kind of laugh and and stuff our faces filled with popcorn and candy but the first 10 minutes of the movie were surprisingly great i love hiroyuki sonata i think he's one of the best actors ever check out the original japanese ring last samurai the wolverine the twilight samurai the guy is amazing and so to see him in this video game movie i was like oh man they're going for authenticity here there's some serious [ __ ] seasoned talent in this movie awesome and then they pulled the 2014 godzilla where that movie started out with brian cranston got us wrapped up into that character and then pivoted to a far less interesting character in aaron taylor johnson's soldier this movie does the same thing by pivoting away from hiroyuki sonata's hanzo hisashi and going to someone named cole young who's an mma fighter an invented character has nothing to do with mortal kombat lore that's fine i don't give a [ __ ] uh do whatever you want as long as the story story's good i just didn't really find this character very interesting he was a down and out kind of underdog fighter who wanted to provide for his family and we've seen that 21 000 times so i don't know it was a strange choice to sort of have him be the protagonist when there is so many a plethora of other more interesting mortal kombat characters to make the protagonist but beyond that i found the movie mostly pretty entertaining especially when kano came on screen josh lawson as kano is a scene stealer without a doubt he's so much of a scene stealer it's mind-boggling it's like he's in a different movie the other great addition to the film is sub-zero he's exactly what i wanted to see from sub-zero a badass who shows up in the real world sometimes kills some people with ice and uh does some [ __ ] up [ __ ] i really liked sub-zero a lot in the film he's what he needed to be as i said my expectations for this movie were give me bloody brutal fights and have them say some funny mortal kombat catchphrases and make me laugh while i choke to death on popcorn and for the most part i got that however i do have one major complaint with the movie and it's unfortunately the way they edited the fight scenes if you've watched my channel for a long time you know that i'm not really a fan of quick cut editing i never have been and i don't really know anyone who is for whatever reason they decided to do that quite often there is a considerable amount of coverage to these fight scenes and the they cut around them a lot and i don't understand why it's just ugly it doesn't have to be that way and the other thing is that while the fights are very bloody at times it seems very focused on the fatality element like we're going to kill this person in a very gruesome way at the end but before that it's very pg-13 the fights don't feel like they have weight to them there's not a lot of impact to the punches characters get boulders thrown on them and then the boulders are picked up and they have like dust on their shoulders and that's it there's there's not a lot of blood until somebody gets sliced in half by a spinning hat okay that's [ __ ] awesome but for the most part it doesn't really feel like people are being hurt or are in danger like i look at a movie like the raid for instance that to me feels more like mortal kombat characters in that movie feel like they are being brutalized and truly viciously savagely hurt here it feels very pg-13 until they're killed and i wish that there was more impact to the way these fights happened and they didn't feel so superhero-y where it feels like everyone can just kind of get up and walk away that's not how i envision mortal kombat and when you're going for a rated r and you have that opportunity to make incredibly well choreographed fights that are also very brutal and you feel that pain and they don't do it i would say that was the movie's biggest actual flaw for me you know i mean the character stuff i expected to be cheesy i expect the world to be silly and over the top i i wanted all of that and the movie gave me that but the best parts of the movie are easily scorpion and sub-zero anything involving those two people [ __ ] great the whole setup of what they could do in the future i don't know i was a little disappointed also that the mortal kombat element of the tournament felt like it was just this thing they talked about sometimes the actual fights between a lot of these characters and the third act felt almost like a montage very quick and throw away but honestly i feel like most mortal kombat fans especially hardcore mortal kombat fans will find enjoyment in this movie and i certainly laughed a lot and had fun while people were being brutally killed i just wish that it was um i'm not saying more gritty or realistic i just want to feel like they are in danger like the pain element of mortal kombat i need to feel like that's part of this universe the next time we see more of these fights i'm gonna give mortal kombat a c plus guys thank you so much as always for watching but i also want to tell you about a pretty cool video game right now that's in the middle of a kickstarter it's called ghosts it's a new fmv game from one of the writer producers of host jed shepherd which recently won the fangoria chainsaw award for best streaming premiere it's a partnership between visible games limited run games trevor henderson and the jim henson creature shop it's targeting all platforms like pc switch ps4

"""https://youtu.be/gruAks6YVXs""",Jakob's Wife,jacob's wife was directed by travis stevens the director of girl on the third floor and stars barbara crampton as a woman trapped in a pretty boring marriage with a minister played by larry fezenden she feels like her life has been shrinking over the past 30 years but encountering the master brings her a new sense of power and an appetite to live bolder however the change comes with a heavy body count i've been looking forward to this movie for a while girl on the third floor wasn't necessarily for everyone but i found a lot of enjoyment in that movie i thought it was extremely well directed and very unique and i wanted to see what travis stevens did with this movie also barbara crampton is a genre legend she's been in great horror films since the 1980s and i love that she has been given a lead role here and given a huge opportunity to flex her comedic muscles as well as her dramatic ones she's easily the best part of the movie this is a script that she championed for many years she read it a few years back and tried to get it made for a long time her and larry fezenden play off each other really well because at the core of the movie it's it's sort of about a relationship that's crumbling to older people who just don't really feel the passion anymore and one of them the husband doesn't really notice just how much his wife is suffering how much she feels like her life isn't worth anything she's really under his thumb and he doesn't even really notice it's one of those relationships where you can't really call him abusive but he's just not really there he doesn't understand just how much she needs and he's pretty okay with constantly talking over her interrupting her all the time so in a moment of relative weakness when she encounters an actual vampire she sees an opportunity to take hold of her life this is something i've seen a lot of directors do lately in writers is that they've basically taken something that is essentially a domestic dispute of some kind a film in which characters just aren't getting along whether their boyfriend girlfriend or married or whatever the [ __ ] and introduce a genre element in fact that's how you really do the best horror movies the best horror movies are dramas that were compelling stories and you can maybe make a whole movie out of it but you're introducing a genre element to it whether it's a vampire or a ghost or a possession or some kind of thing and jacob's wife does that very well but it also wisely understands how funny it could be to see a couple that's been married for a long time suddenly feel like they have to stake people through the heart because the wife is craving blood and larry phezenden in particular does a really great job with the humor in the movie sometimes the comedic tone shifts don't always feel natural there are scenes that feel very serious and kind of important and suddenly there's a joke and it doesn't always work and sometimes it's so jarring that it actually does work and you get the laugh because you just weren't expecting it in a scene like this and it's pretty much impossible to not notice how cool it is that two older actors are getting the showcase in a horror movie where hollywood is so dominated with 20-somethings in these movies it's awesome to see these seasoned pros staking vampires through the heart and sucking the blood off of a torn off head that being said not everything about the movie worked for me sometimes as i said those tonal shifts weren't as polished as they could be and the genre stuff that the characters do you know sneaking into an old place where there's rats and maybe two wooden crates it feels like they're limited a little bit by their budget here and trying to figure out exactly what they want to have on screen and there were a few performances from some supporting characters that weren't quite there yet just not quite up to speed yet but for the most part i really enjoyed jacob's wife because of the commentary that it presented about how a woman in marriage for so many years can feel trapped and see an opportunity to really flourish and take hold of a life that she never had before and the film is smart and that this married couple don't immediately solve all of their problems nor does one of them just immediately end their relationship they both feel like well we're at an age where we kind of have to figure this [ __ ] out we can't just like move on with like what are we gonna do about this and so that was interesting because it forced the husband to come to terms with how he treated her in the past a lot of times in in movies where they have messages like this whoever was being wrong is is killed or is immediately out of the picture this movie says no try to fix it make an attempt at fixing it i'm gonna give jacob's wife a b-minus yeah there's vampire stuff and blood and gore which you want to see but there was actually a surprising amount of substance and depth to the characters although the tonal shifts didn't always work and i think that could have been polished a little bit more i think this is definitely worth seeing so i took a couple weeks off uh it's been a long time since i've actually done that i've i've usually done at least a video a week for uh forever but i've actually been working on some film projects on the side and i'm really happy about that and i'm looking forward to being able to share more info with you in the future i'm sorry i can't really give you any details it's just fun stuff that i've been able to do and i'm moving in the direction i want to move in and it's it's really exciting for me so in the future i'll share more with you guys until then thank you so much as always

"""https://youtu.be/Y7HhSWV8-2E""",The Vigil,the vigil was written and directed by keith thomas and is about a young man who is assigned the task of watching over a recently deceased person overnight in their home as an opening text informs us this is a common practice in the orthodox jewish community when a loved one passes away someone close to that person may sit with the body but when a close loved one is not available sometimes someone will be paid to perform the services and our lead character played by dave davis is assigned that difficult task and as you can imagine sitting in a house all night long with a dead body is ripe for horror i'm a little late to the party on this one i've heard a lot of people talking about the vigil over the past few months and it showed it a few places and some critics were buzzing about it but mostly it's actually been filmmakers who've been excited about this movie and i can completely understand why this is a really damn good horror film made on a tight budget with almost one location only and it never drags they find really exciting ways to use this location to their advantage keith thomas and his cinematographer zach cooperstein light the house in a very thrilling way they use shadows to their advantage you often don't know what's going to peer out of them and this is a major challenge for indie filmmakers especially in the horror realm it's a lot easier to get a film financed when you can tell your financiers or the studio or whoever it is that you're working with the film takes place in one spot with only a few cast members that's a very reasonable approach to making a horror film and making it on a budget and oftentimes you can feel a script pulling and pulling until it breaks apart because they don't know where to put these people anymore because they've gone in every room and they've explored every area of the house and where do we go from here the vigil only rarely encounters that kind of strain because the director and lead star dave davis do such a good job of setting up a compelling character that you really care about it makes for a great character for a horror film especially for this plot because what he's been assigned to do is technically a religious practice something that he might have done a little more easily in the past but since he's been feeling doubt and having complications with his faith it's not just about a dead body in a house there's a lot of deep themes to the film and through careful flashbacks at just the right times you can understand why he's having a slight crisis of faith and how he might have to overcome that over the course of the night to survive once things get really scary there's also a terrifying older woman in the house played masterfully by lynn cohen who's really creepy in the movie she plays the wife of the deceased who is not exactly in the right state to watch over a dead body and that's why we have our lead character there she often appears to scare the  out of us throughout the course of the movie but also at times be a bit of an expository mouthpiece for things that we're supposed to know the film also has a really great way of sidestepping the we have to keep them in a house thing that often happens in lower budget horror in that when our hero tries to leave the house it feels as if this entity that wants to keep him there has overcome his body with a debilitating feeling that every bone is breaking it's a very clever way to not let him get too far away from the house and keep the budget tight you know i'm talking a lot about that but i think that's one of the reasons why so many filmmakers were excited when they saw this movie because they saw somebody who understood the constraints that he was under and delivered a compelling story and a compelling film that was still really exciting and thrilling regardless that's what i think so many indie filmmakers are searching for they're looking for that story that they can get financed that hopefully has something to offer that feels deeper that feels richer than your average horror movie about a dead body and a person there are very few movies that actually work with this type of setup another one could be autopsy of jane doe but there's tons of movies about a dead body in a building and somebody who has to watch over it or somebody who works in a morgue late night and they're stuck at the morgue for the whole movie very rarely do they work this well and of course there's something to be said about the fact that in regards to religion and horror movies catholicism pretty much reigns supreme it's very unique and refreshing to see a perspective of an orthodox jewish ritual that lends to a horror story now like i already said there are a few times where the script can sometimes feel like it's being strained a little bit by the fact that they pretty much have to stay in one house the film is a good length and the performance by dave davis really helps but sometimes it's like well now we should probably go in this room now we should probably go downstairs maybe i'll try to go upstairs and see what's up there and you can tell that they're doing their best to figure out exactly what to do with this limited location but with the use of his phone as well and people he's calling and strange messages he receives they get a lot out of that and i was really impressed with the vigil i'm gonna give it a b plus i think when it comes to the independent horror film in a house this is definitely one of the better examples in recent years guys thank

"""https://youtu.be/u3TEDuzBcPc""",Godzilla vs. Kong,godzilla vs kong is directed by adam wingard and as you might expect is a movie where godzilla and kong fight take all of my money now basically some scientists are trying to find a location that is of myth they believe that kong could perhaps lead them to it and godzilla is out in the world wreaking havoc and killing people so folks are confused godzilla tends to be someone who kind of balances the scales of justice and does the right thing so why does it appear that he's killing innocent people and of course eventually these two titans are gonna sort some [ __ ] out quick backstory that vhs king kong vs godzilla was on repeat constantly when i was in elementary school it's a very cheesy movie admittedly especially if you watch the american version but that little kid didn't give a [ __ ] he loved it and he watched it all the time and that kid that's still inside me had a big cheesy grin throughout almost this entire film i really had a good time with godzilla vs kong because it basically gives you exactly what you want it doesn't overstay its welcome it's a very tightly paced movie and that it's the shortest so far in this most recent series of godzilla and king kong films the movie doesn't waste too much time with things that you might not necessarily care about and it doesn't have a grand aspiration towards really anything else than entertaining the hell out of you with a series of epic bouts between godzilla and kong they do not disappoint that's what you want to see that's what's on the poster the movie delivers that 100 especially in the latter half the second half of the movie is almost non-stop kong and godzilla stuff and it's really exciting and fun now one complaint that's been thrown around a lot for these recent kong and godzilla movies and i've certainly said it is that the human characters are kind of boring most people watch these movies for the titans and we all know that but it would still be nice if you kind of cared about the little ants that are walking around on the ground this movie is very self-aware in that it does the bare minimum basics for the human characters it establishes the characters their motivations their goals why are they in this movie why are they doing what they're doing and it gives traits to each one of them some are overly serious some are very funny some are paranoid and some characters cancel each other out brian tyree henry was very funny as a conspiratorial podcast host who has a lot of thoughts about what the government is doing and some of them end up being true so getting to watch him discover that his paranoid rantings on the internet are actually fact was very funny but julian dennison who i loved and hunt for the wilder people is also there for comic relief and those two characters are sort of on a side quest with millie bobby brown's character and sometimes it feels like the movie stops when we're with them eventually there's a concrete reason for them being in the movie and the characters are entertaining and as i said brian tyree henry is very funny and likable and so he definitely makes his scenes very enjoyable but alexander skarsgard and rebecca hall are basically the main story they're trying to find this hidden world and kong is leading them there this was really smart because instead of having kong just be an animal that occasionally appears to wreak some havoc he's integral to the story they need him for the story so not only do we get to see more of the monsters but they made them more integral to the story this time around but as i said the film is extremely well paced in that it gives you just enough of the human people because they're really not that interesting and what they're trying to do can at times be a little incomprehensible the best way that i can describe godzilla vs kong is that it feels like an early 2000s movie and i mean that as a compliment there used to be films that were just big fun movies and that's it they had the needed character development the bare minimum basics but the movies knew why you were there they were very self-aware they didn't have these grand aspirations to be these overly pretentious human dramas and i miss times like that at the movies where it just felt like you could go and have a fun time even if it is disposable it's almost like the film knows it is and is totally okay with that adam wingard does so many fun things with the fight sequences in the movie he simulates a camera that's mounted to their arms sometimes so when they throw punches it creates this great sort of dizzying effect the fights are gorgeous the visual effects truly have reached an amazing amazing period like we are in the future the the look of this movie is absolutely breathtaking i do think there's one missed opportunity though there's an area of the film without getting into details where gravity is sort of [ __ ] up i really wish that godzilla and kong fought in that spot somehow it could have been like the inception fight of godzilla and kong it feels like a missed opportunity there's also one close-up of godzilla in the film when he's really kicking kong's ass that i feel like some people won't know what to make of it i thought it was really funny i liked it a lot and i laughed but some people might think it's like out of character or something i don't know i i liked it also can i just say that kyle chandler has now been in two films with kong that are completely separated from each other he was in the peter jackson king kong and now this that's so strange but cool good for him man he's he's out there making the money so even though the human aspect of the movie again is just something i don't really care that much about there is one part of the film that i think they absolutely knocked out of the park there's a young girl in the film that's able to communicate with kong that was absolutely the heart and soul of the movie and created some surprisingly touching moments that i did not expect now granted this movie is not going to be for everybody if you go into godzilla versus kong ready to analyze the in-depth meaning and the hidden metaphors of the shots and visual implications of everyone's state of mind you'll probably not like the movie but if you just want to see godzilla and kong throw punches you're going to have a blast i'm going to give godzilla versus kong a b guys thank you so much as always for watching and thank you as well to the sponsor for this video skillshare skillshare

"""https://youtu.be/kV4QLH8lilQ""",The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run,the spongebob movie sponge on the run is finally released i am a big spongebob fan i love this show i liked it the most in its first three seasons the first movie was pretty good second movie was okay uh i'll admit i haven't really watched any new spongebob for a while but the early stuff i think is classic and i've always loved it and in this film spongebob's pet snail gary is taken by an evil king who uses snail goo to make himself look young so spongebob and patrick team up to go and rescue gary i was looking forward to seeing this movie last year spongebob is one of the last cartoons of like the golden nickelodeon era that's still running and is still popular and every once in a while new stuff comes out i'm a big fan of the 90s nicktoons and so naturally i wanted to see what this movie was about supposed to come out last year i was really excited for it i even bought this thing look at this thing this is like the greatest thing i own it's the classic spongebob meme look i'm even gonna i'm gonna open it you guys get a review and an unboxing check me out look at this thing this is so stupid can he stand up holy [ __ ] he can stand that's gonna that should just stay there forever now but then the pandemic pushed it back and it came out in other countries but not in america and so i had to wait to see it and i finally got to see it and man was this a mediocre movie i was very disappointed to to see that it was sort of like an excuse to promote camp coral this new spongebob show the movie often derails from its narrative to focus on spongebob and his friends when they were young at a place called camp coral this happens quite a few times in the film lo and behold there's a new camp coral show coming out and i guess it's out already i don't know i'm not that type of guy that's like oh new stuff from an old property that i loved when i was a kid that can't be good that's gonna suck i'm not no i'm not that guy i'm open to new things but it just felt kind of weird but that's not to say that this is by any means a terrible film or that they only made this movie to promote a show it was clearly part of their agenda but the animation is really gorgeous it's fully 3d this time the last film sponge out of water combine 2d animation and 3d animation whenever they went outside of the water i think that was sort of their way of easing us classic 2d fans into the 3d era for this show because this film is fully 3d and while it does look beautiful it doesn't quite look like spongebob to me i think i'm just very used to the way he looks when he's 2d and i've always appreciated that but obviously they put a ton of work into this animation and it does look very beautiful the film has a few major themes that it wants young people to take away and all of them are very positive and there's a lot of good morals going around this isn't a film that panders to children in any way or makes children feel stupid it's actually a fairly smart film when it comes to child like humor there's some silly jokes but some of them actually have some thought behind them as the best spongebob jokes do the most prominent theme is friendship how important it is being a friend to people who don't have any friends and in one of the film's funnier scenes it hilariously pokes fun at the structure that movies like this tend to have when it comes to a friendship or relationship when they break up when they fight when they get back together but the film also has a pretty good message about how we view ourselves physically how people might perceive us if we don't look like a magazine model and i can tell you that if i had entertainment like that for me when i was in middle school at my heaviest i would have really liked seeing that so it was really nice to see a children's animation film address things like body positivity in a way that could be very valuable for kids to hear unfortunately the film didn't really feel like it had a story it kind of felt like a series of sketches and most of them weren't very funny there were a few that stood out that i thought were hilarious and i love these characters i love spongebob and patrick squidward is always going to be my favorite character i relate the most to him probably because he's just like well you know he's kind of like me so even though the story felt kind of mediocre to me at the very least the film had the characters that i know and love going for it and the camp coral tie-in stuff felt strange and that aspect of the movie was a disappointment although young people who want to watch camp coral could be very excited by that i just feel like it was unnecessary and didn't really need to be in the film i'm gonna give the spongebob movie sponge on the run a c plus guys thank you so much as always for watching but i also want to give a big thank you to the sponsor for this video shopify and the

"""https://youtu.be/tUrYg1o7cLs""",Zack Snyder's Justice League,zack snyder's justice league is now streaming on hbo max and today i watched all four hours of it of course i was going to review this i just didn't get a screener for it i decided to watch it with everybody else when it went live on hbo max so let's talk about it all of you probably already know the history of this film it was a very troubled production joss whedon came in to change some things around ended up changing a lot more than perhaps we initially thought he did there was a cgi mustache and all kinds of interesting things and after a lot of campaigning from the fans and stars and zack snyder himself he was finally able to release his vision onto hbo max unencumbered by studio interference and in 4x3 aspect ratio which some people don't like i love it looks beautiful like i really prefer that tall image that clearly was made for imax presentation it felt really unique a lot of directors filmed their movies for imax in that aspect ratio but they don't release that aspect ratio on blu-ray even when they do it's not exactly imax like the mission impossible fallout blu-ray for instance the black bars go away to a 16x9 image which still isn't quite imax but it's something i would love if brad bird would release an imax version of mission impossible ghost protocol at home but he has said that he doesn't think that that's going to look good at home and for some people they may hate it i want to see the full frame i don't care if i have to watch it on a 77 inch screen in my basement which is where i would watch it i want to see that image i want to see the full image shot regardless of where the black bars show up on my tv which is why i'm very happy that zack snyder maintained the 4x3 aspect ratio i think this movie looks great and even though i certainly didn't hate the 2017 justice league i found it very mediocre and i've never wanted to watch it again and i haven't since seeing it this film is infinitely better zack snyder's justice league is a deeper richer version of a film that we only saw parts of and having seen his version of the movie i can confirm that all my favorite scenes from the joss whedon version are actually zack snyder's scenes it's very eye-opening to realize that the best scenes were snyder's this movie also improves on some characterization namely cyborg cyborg actually feels like a fleshed-out person in this movie quite a bit of characterization has been given to him i won't get too much into spoilers but you see what goes on in his mind you understand his family background a lot better where his presence was fairly routine and kind of boring in the original cut here he shines as one of the most important characters in the film the use of humor is also toned down considerably but toned up from zack snyder's other films so it feels like it's right on the level of where it should be especially with barry allen played by ezra miller character is very funny and miller's good in the role but it doesn't feel like overkill and some of the more cringy jokes from the original cut like him falling on top of wonder woman are nowhere to be seen batman's awkward humor also nowhere to be seen the movie feels so much more cohesive and surprisingly so like honestly i'll be completely upfront i wasn't really looking forward to watching this i like zack snyder a lot i don't like all of his movies i think he seems like a really great guy and i have said this a hundred times and i'll say it again i am always on the side of the filmmaker i am so glad that snyder got to realize his vision got to show it to people and got to right or wrong for him in his career i'm always going to be on the side of the filmmaker and i'm really really happy that his vision is now out there but since i found the original justice league so mediocre i just couldn't really get that hyped for this so the film did nothing but surprise me although some aspects of the film don't quite work for me i did find myself really enjoying watching it even though it was so long this series is still struggling to figure out just what to do with amy adams as lois lane she's referred to as a key character by someone and she does have to do something that is very important in the movie but for the most part she appears sporadically to mourn the loss of clark kent for most of the movie that is her purpose and obviously the run time this is incredibly long i did have to take a break two hours in and just sort of stretch for like 10-15 minutes have a snack and then watch the rest it's a very long film and in some ways you can sort of lose track of things if you're not really thinking about everything that's going on and i can understand why at one point they thought about breaking this up like a mini-series it did feel like four really good episodes of a justice league mini-series the battle on themyscira for instance was jaw-droppingly better this time it felt like a baton race as they were passing the mother box between each other that whole part of it just felt like its own movie so i can see why that may have been a good idea to have a mini-series in a way i think they did something like that with the extended cut of the hateful aid on netflix i think they broke it up a little bit i can't remember for sure and there were a few scenes that probably didn't have to be in the movie i think there is a three hour or three and a half hour cut of this movie that would absolutely be snyder's vision and i think eventually zack snyder probably looked at all of the fans who were al pacino and heat this and give me all your god and he did just that because i think that even if schneider hadn't have had the interference from warner brothers and from the whedon cut that he did have i i can't imagine that this version would have been what he released in theaters i know there was discussion about splitting the film up but this is actually one of the things i'm most excited about here i'm very excited about a movie of this length being successful on a streaming platform because if you look at a film like avengers end game the movie's three hours in one minute or something because the movie has to fill enough theater slots every day to get enough people to come to the theater and make their money back and if a film is so long they can only program a few showings of it per day but three hours was kind of pushing it but the fact that hbo max exists or netflix or hulu or whatever this is really exciting to me that a filmmaker can recommend something that is so against the theatrical experience and have it be successful and have it be greenlit this is really exciting for filmmakers because for a long time the way movies got made was at the behest of the theatrical exhibition experience but if you do not have those rules and you can say actually i would like to make my movie this way which is very strange and not normal per se you have the option to do things like streaming services now which really is cool and exciting for filmmakers now i'm assuming that a lot of you have seen the movie but i do want to talk about a few issues i have with the film that are spoilery so if you have not yet seen the film i'm going to talk about spoilers for a second first off there's like 20 minutes at the end that felt sort of return of the king asked like it just kept going and going and it felt like the movie had ended there's a extended dream or vision sequence with batman and joker and while the conversation he had with joker was certainly more adult than i was expecting the fact that it was a vision or a dream and the unsure nature of whether or not we'll even see that come to a head in the future it felt very tacked on as did the martian manhunter scene which again look it was cool to see that character but the revelation that he was martha kent and then later he comes back again it felt sort of like it would have been a more exciting reveal to just see him visit bruce wayne at the end to see him for the first time after that scene with lois and like i said it was cool to see that character meeting at the end with bruce wayne but i don't know if it really needed to be in the film if they end up somehow continuing this story even though zack snyder has expressed that he would like to move on and understandably so then that feels more justified but his inclusion now feels sort of like a fun thing that we can just enjoy seeing i don't know that it was necessary for the movie but at the same time do you guys ever just watch a movie and you're like yeah i enjoyed watching that and then you if you review movies like professionally if you feel like you have to somehow talk negatively about it and maybe you just don't feel like it right now i just don't feel like it i'm glad that fans got to see this i'm glad that zack snyder got to release the movie he wanted to make i'm always going to be on the side of filmmakers there's a few things about the movie that didn't sit right with me but honestly i enjoyed watching it and i'm gonna give it a b plus as i said this movie could only surprise me and it did it was considerably better than i thought it was going to be and even though there are still some bigger than life things that don't always emotionally connect with me there's some song choices that felt a little bit out of place i'm just glad that the film is done and that snyder got to do his thing that's really inspiring to me that a filmmaker could come back after everything that he went through and just finish his movie i like i said i wasn't really hyped to see it but i'm glad i did and i'm even more excited about what it could mean for filmmakers in regards to streaming services and the differences between how you can make a movie for a streaming service or for a theater and how much more freedom you have guys thank you so much as always for watching

"""https://youtu.be/T6UVZGa25Uc""",Tom and Jerry,tom and jerry it's directed by tim story the man behind barbershop taxi the first two fantastic four films most recently shaft and this film finds tom the cat and jerry the mouse running into each other in new york city eventually meeting chloe grace moretz who's trying to work at a fancy hotel hoping that a wedding between two insanely rich people goes well and it kind of sucks for her that a cat and mouse keep getting in the way tom and jerry follows the formula of just about every one of the older cartoons that have been adapted to a film it takes place in new york city it has a lot of human characters we don't give a [ __ ] about and really terrible slapstick that isn't funny recycle jokes from a billion other movies involving poop and farts all we really came to see is tom and jerry and they're barely in the movie because tom and jerry are two animals that don't speak that run around for five minutes or so and hit each other with heavy objects the old cartoon is fun i used to watch it a lot as a kid it was kind of the thing that would be on when i'd be eating breakfast it's not like i cared about the plot of tom and jerry it was just entertaining it wasn't like i was excited every single week to find out what happens next time on tom and jerry it was just tom and jerry and they ran around and hit each other with things so to make a whole movie out of it and a 100 minute movie at that you can really feel them straining to come up with ideas as the film plays out these birds routinely appear throughout the movie to break the fourth wall and remind us of what is going on in the plot i'm not exaggerating there are scenes with the birds where they stare at us and give us a recap of what has recently happened just in case we forgot check this out in celebrity news major commotion at the royal gate hotel as new york's elite couple preet and ben are tying the knot at a private intimate wedding when we meet kayla played by chloe grace moretz she's on the best quality facetime call ever quitting her job so she walks into this very fancy hotel finds a woman there that's applying for a job this woman's very excited about this job it means a lot to her and kayla convinces her to not even apply she lies and manipulates her to the point where she scares the [ __ ] out of her and this woman just leaves without applying for the job then kayla steals this woman's resume and applies for the job and gets it and for some reason i guess this was the film's way of making me like that character well it didn't work now obviously the film is trying to set up an arc for her where she starts out a terrible person along the way tom and jerry and their cat and mouse-like antics will make her realize that she should have been a better person and hopefully admit her faults but to have that be the introduction to what is essentially the protagonist of your movie it was strange because this is a film for kids and this film is saying that to get to the top you have to lie and cheat and steal and step over someone else's hard work to get a job you want yup it's definitely a big hollywood movie they love that [ __ ] which brings me to the main thing i couldn't help but think about throughout the whole movie this is a film where people got paid there's nothing in the movie that reminded me of the cartoon except for the fact that tom and jerry are in it and occasionally they hit each other with things this is a movie about a socialite wedding with two super rich people who want elephants and tigers and drones dji drones specifically because we get a lot of product placement with those [ __ ] drones they want all that [ __ ] at their wedding and they're having marital problems that chloe grace moretz can maybe help her with because she lost the ring and he's kind of clueless and michael pina who runs parts of the hotel is annoyed that this woman has gotten this job and he doesn't think she's qualified and all of that is happening for the majority of the movie occasionally tom and jerry appear for the most part though it's everyone else but maybe the comedy could save it maybe it could be funny michael pina is [ __ ] hilarious this movie has a lot of people in it that are good with comedy unfortunately they went for embarrassing awkward cringe humor like people just talk and talk and talk in a scene until they realize they're being embarrassing but they're not saying anything funny well everyone stares at them and then they go sorry and walk away that kind of humor where would you say that person should love oh my god i i i love riddles um uh well if if i were that someone but i'm not but i could be who knows one day one can only dream vip sorry back to the question um it would depend on the size of the object is it a car is it alive could it be a dog i lose things all the time i lost my baby brother last week don't tell anyone please because i was like joey where are you please and then thank the lord constantly over and over again people do very embarrassing things in public in front of crowds you know like a fish that's animated has a little thought bubble and in the thought bubble is the poop emoji that's that's the level we're at here guys and i understand that it's a tom and jerry movie i did not go into this movie expecting highbrow entertainment i just would love if movies like this respected children if they seem to even remotely care about children and not pandering to them and not treating children like they're idiots this is a movie that parents can turn on to make their infants not do anything for 90 minutes well 100 minutes but your kids aren't going to retain anything from this if anything they're going to learn to lie cheat and steal to get to the top which isn't exactly what you want your kids to do i'm sure it's actually kind of shocking how much of the film is about people and this plot about a wedding with two super rich people at a hotel that we genuinely don't care about because they're actually being faithful in that tom and jerry do not speak and so to make a feature film out of this ip they obviously had to populate it with people and get a lot of actors who made some money i'll tell you that this film reminded me of the smurfs which if you've watched my channel for a long time you know those movies have really rubbed me the wrong way over the years but i don't know what it is about these films where the studio just thinks well we have this ip this old cartoon let's just throw him in new york city let's just have him go to the big apple we'll have some some antics with some people and it plays like a series of awkward embarrassing cringe humor sketches from snl and they even hired an snl actor this time so that's cool look i didn't expect anything going into this movie i was just going to watch it and review it i am honestly really shocked though that these films that just don't really care about kids just keep getting made there's nothing in the film that a kid can can watch and think oh that was special or that meant it's just the thing that can be on while they're sitting there eating their [ __ ] alphabet soup the best thing i can say about the movie is that uh they released it it got made uh it's a real movie that's out and i guess it probably employed people which is [ __ ] cool people made money people paid their bills i'm gonna give tom and jerry an f uh it's basically like the smurfs and yogi bear and you know it's it's right in there guys it's like all that i don't know why they can't make a good one uh they're just they're struggling thank you guys so much as always for watching but i also do want to give a big thank you to the sponsor for this video squarespace

"""https://youtu.be/NzeFd69U3PY""",Cherry,cherry is directed by the russo brothers and stars tom holland as a man who is driven to become a bank robber in the style of forrest gump he narrates his journey through the military through finding love becoming a drug addict and eventually robbing banks this film was shot entirely in cleveland which is really awesome it looked great i recognized a lot of the places and i know some people who worked on this movie and i love you guys unfortunately i did not love this movie and i'm sorry if you're watching this review really wasn't my cup of tea this film could have been great i think tom holland is excellent in the movie he gives a great performance and he is constantly engaging he has so much charisma his character is mostly interesting because of him it's one of those characters that isn't very interesting on the page and having an a-list actor like tom holland in the role really helps things a lot this is based off of an autobiographical book by nico walker who serves as a producer on this film and while his life is obviously filled with a lot of trauma tragedy and choices he probably regrets and is very happy to be in a position that he is now it's not that interesting in this movie mostly due to the russo brothers unfortunately i really like their directing i think they did a great job with the mcu they made maybe the best one of the best certainly with winter soldier but they adopted a style in cherry that is so flashy so in your face and so self-indulgent that the story didn't really come to life because i was constantly distracted by the way they helmed this movie for instance when tom holland is going through various procedures when he joins the military he has to get a rectal exam and you don't really know what we're looking at at first but the camera is deep in a pink dark cavernous hole and you just see an eye looking through that hole and then you realize they they stuck a camera in his ass obviously it was a prosthetic colon but what just choices like that baffled me throughout the whole movie but the real thing that absolutely tanks this movie for me is the narration it is the most on the nose explanatory voiceover i've heard in a film in so long i'll give you a perfect example there's a character you know throughout the whole movie he's one of tom holland's buddies you see him go on some bank robberies they drive around town you've seen this character for like an hour to 90 minutes or so you don't really know much about him later in the film tom holland has a safe and he really would like to get into that safe so he calls his friend the same guy you've known for like an hour or so in the movie the narration then tells us i called my buddy because he used to work for a locksmith i was like oh interesting characterization that i've just been informed of that's such a lazy approach to the way this narration could have gone the unspoken rule with a voiceover and it's not really unspoken actually a lot of people say this is that if you're gonna have voiceover have it enhance the story in a way that you could not communicate visually the film also has a final shot that is so curious to me it's one of the strangest miscalculations and tone or feel that i've experienced and really the whole movie can be described that way the final shot of the movie is right out of nacho libre which probably is not what you expected me to say but i couldn't help but think it it just it looked like nacho libre it just did um i'm sure i can't possibly be the only person on this planet that will think that there's things to admire in cherry for the most part the performances are all really strong the russo brothers are being extremely ambitious they're taking a lot of risks and i always admire that unfortunately none of them really pay off this film doesn't really have much of a story it's basically a guy falls into drugs after being disrespected by the military him and his girlfriend have problems and he decides to rob banks so it seems like the russo brothers adopted this very flashy style that i guess was supposed to maintain your interest over an extremely bloated run time and it just didn't the film also has a lot of attempts at themes and messages there's an approach to the way we treat our veterans but it is so minimal and barely discussed and when it is discussed it's usually voice over and so you don't really feel it you're just being told it also all the banks that he robs have titles like shitty bank or the bank to be honest i don't really get it i have no qualms and saying that i don't really get what they were going for it wasn't clear to me and i think that's one of the other reasons that the film just didn't work for me there were so many approaches to a theme where i felt like they were just about getting interesting and then they would backtrack i admire that they're clearly attempting to do something completely different than a big superhero extravaganza movie i just don't think it worked for me i'm going to give cherry a c minus the film's opening in theaters this weekend and then eventually it's going to be on apple tv plus um in march i believe so look forward to that if you want to see it i would suggest watching it if you can just because it's weird it's just not my thing i don't know it didn't work for me guys thank you so much as always for watching but i also want to give a big thank you to the sponsor for this video skillshare skillshare is an online learning community with thousands of

"""https://youtu.be/lu0hgQfHj1A""",Hoosiers,hoosiers came out in 1986 and it starred gene hackman as a basketball coach trying to get away from a checkered past despite having coached college basketball he takes a job in indiana coaching a high school basketball team and over the course of a very unpredictable season leads them to greatness this film was directed by david and spa sorry if i said his name incorrectly but he later made rudy another very inspiring sports film with the same writer and another score from jerry goldsmith as goldsmith provided the excellent score for this movie which was oscar nominated he clearly understands inspiring sports movies and hoosiers is one of my favorite sports films ever this film has so much heart every time i watch the film i am on the verge of tears for almost the entire run time there are so many scenes especially with dennis hopper's character who plays a drunk father of a son on the team he's the embarrassment of his son who is always trying as hard as he can on the court and academically so later in the film when hackman decides the best way to get this guy sober is to offer him an assistant coaching job with the stipulation that if he ever shows up drunk for a game he's immediately out of a job and that's where the film gets even more inspiring the film is smart in that it's not just about a coach who's trying to whip a bunch of boys into shape who just really aren't that good at basketball and can't work together anymore it's about a man trying to recover from alcoholism it's about a lonely teacher who's been taking care of the best basketball player in the area and feels like her life has suddenly halted and that she'll never get out of this place and it's about a coach that feels like the whole town is against him especially since the first few rules that he instigates are very confusing to the town this is a town where basketball is extremely important to it it's god and basketball as far as this town is concerned and so when gene hackman comes in there and says you can't even shoot the ball until you've passed at least four times everyone's very confused by that and they even try to vote him out of a job nowadays a storyline like this feels very formulaic there have been many films since and some before where a gruff guy comes into a school whether he's a teacher or a coach and there's a bunch of players or students who just don't really work together and they're failing at academics or in athletics and eventually you're going to be inspired in some way usually the town is against said individual perhaps it'll be a town hall meeting of some kind and we've seen things like that in films like coach carter or remember the titans which are both good films remember the titans actually being a great film i think but when hoosiers came out these storylines weren't as familiar and a lot of films have taken inspiration from it gene hackman is very very good in hoosiers despite clashing with the director considerably apparently the director even had anxiety attacks sometimes fearing working with hackman because hackman legitimately thought this movie was going to be a disaster he actually thought it was going to end his career i can't imagine thinking that about this film now but i suppose at the time he just wasn't seeing what was happening in front of him according to the imdb trivia after seeing a rough cut of the film gene hackman came into the room took his glasses off and said how the hell did you do that which i find really entertaining and i love that he was able to at least admit that because obviously the film was a boost for his career at the time because if you look at the films he was making after superman and superman 2 and then to hoosiers there's not much going on there this film really helped him actually but dennis hopper is the shining star of this movie he was oscar nominated for his role and there are scenes with him that are so so painful and he gives such a real performance it doesn't feel showy even in the film's showiest scene where he's stumbling onto the basketball court drunk in front of everyone it doesn't feel like he's playing for the audience apparently he would spin around multiple times before a take just so he could get that feeling of what he might feel like if he was inebriated and he's excellent in the film and he's one of the biggest reasons that i often cry during this movie like a child the basketball action is also really well filmed it looks realistic it doesn't feel like they're being big just to be big for the movie and has already stated jerry goldsmith's score is really excellent it really pumps you up it's a great workout score it's it's very inspiring music i really miss hearing new music from that man there's only a few things about the movie that aren't as strong as everything else there isn't anything about the movie that i would say doesn't work it's just that some elements kind of fall by the wayside the romance between barbara hershey and gene hackman is natural and it develops slowly and there's a nice evolution to it but i don't know that it adds much to the narrative i feel like it's just something that a lot of films at the time felt like they had to have a blossoming romance of some kind along with the rest of the drama i don't know the film needs it but i don't really think it takes away from anything and that's just me being nitpicky which is kind of unnecessary this has always been one of my favorite sports movies and if you've never seen it i would highly recommend it i'm going to give hoosiers an a guys thank you so much as always for watching i'm gonna have some more sports reviews coming for you very soon as i promised in my review of

"""https://youtu.be/eUTWW42lKHk""",Akira,[Applause] akira was directed by katsuhiro otomo and is a landmark in animation history it's often credited as the film that made anime famous in america as a kid at the time i was fascinated by the aura surrounding this movie there was so much talk about it people would chatter about this movie all the time those who saw it would talk about how violent it is how gory it is and this film generated a mystique around it before anyone even saw it and it's rarely that a film lives up to that hype but akira is one of the few that does and recently i realized that i don't have a review for this film on my channel which is kind of crazy i'm always talking about this movie i'm always referencing it i've seen it many times and it's fantastic and with the release of the 4k ultra hd blu-ray that happened recently i thought this would be a perfect time to talk about akira finally for those who have not seen the film because i'm positive that some of the people watching this video haven't i'm not going to get into spoilers but i will talk a little bit about plot details and perhaps go a little farther than i normally would just as a bit of a warning when it comes to this movie i feel like it's important to say that it's not exactly what you think it is if you've never seen it i think a lot of people think of akira as a cyberpunk film that has motorbikes and a lot of gore yeah all that's there but the film is extremely psychological and very deep and it takes a few viewings to really get everything in fact i've seen the film multiple times and i do feel like i learned something new every time i watch it because there are things that are just a hundred percent not explained you kind of just have to link things together in your mind there's an explosion that happens early on in the film and then text pops up that says that this is in 2019 after world war three if you accept that description of the environment that you're watching then the film will make sense but there is a deeper meaning to that explosion at the beginning that i didn't even really catch the first few times i watched this movie because the film is a lot smarter than you might think it is the first few times i saw akira and even now i don't really love too many of the characters i would say it's my biggest flaw with the movie beyond some convoluted plotting that can be very confusing the characters aren't very memorable they serve their purpose kanida in particular is very brash doesn't seem to have a lot of motivation or drive in life and he's a bit of an sure the world around him has shaped him into this but i do wish that character was more compelling i wish that i gave a about him but i i don't really tetsuo is easily the most interesting character in the whole film early in the film tetsuo encounters a kid who looks like an old man after a confusing explosion occurs that saves the kid's life but blows tetsuo away he's taken captive and when he resurfaces he suddenly has all these powers and abilities telekinesis psychic premonitions and they're destroying his brain he's seeing horrific things that are right out of a david lynch movie disgusting body gore and frightening imagery haunt his mind and on the surface it seems mostly about a kid who gains some abilities who can't control them because he's a kid and so power and the way you wield it it's very dangerous yeah sure all that's part of akira as well but the film gets far deeper in a psychological sense especially when it comes to the creation of things that happen near the end of the film which i won't get into but the movie has a lot to say along with some of the most stunning animation ever put to screen the hand-drawn work by these artists is iconic the opening motorbike chase is still thrilling but the dedication to the backgrounds as well crowds of people filling the screen explosions happening in the distance and a jaw-dropping sense of scope make akira the classic that it is as already alluded to the plotting can get a little confusing there's a portion of the beginning of the second act that drags and you don't feel like much is happening you're sort of just understanding how this world works you're meeting other secondary characters and kind of figuring out what they want to do with their lives but as i already said the characters of akira aren't all that compelling tetsuo is easily the one that you're most curious about that is going through something that's exciting and you want to know what he's going to do but akira is given credit for making anime famous in america and other countries outside of japan because of how impressive everything is this was that movie that people talked about because in america cartoons were bugs bunny and wiley coyote to have a guy's guts open up and spill all over the street and a dude get shot like a hundred times in animation form was very striking and disturbing the first time i saw the film and for many people this movie was visually arresting there's absolutely a crowd of people who just want to watch akira for the motorbikes and the gore but there's a lot more under the surface in particular the way the people can rise up against a government when they feel that they are being treated unjustly or when they feel that the government is keeping a lot of secrets in this case there's a group of people who believe that akira is sort of like jesus and eventually there'll be a second coming of akira and when tetsuo appears with all of these abilities they sort of look to him and think well see we were right and you can see these people and the police and the government clashing and over the past few years akira doesn't seem too much like science fiction anymore i'm gonna give akira an a i think if the characters were stronger and the plotting was less confusing on the first few viewings i'd be giving this movie an a plus like i said if you've never seen it before prepare to pay attention this isn't just a movie that's like an extreme g scene side point those games were awesome i would love another extreme g game guys thank you so much as

"""https://youtu.be/_mMJjJqmx4I""",Tokyo Godfathers,this bundle of joy is a christmas present sent from god she's our baby now you know what sounds a lot weirder the fact we have a crying baby in here i'm not saying you're wrong but what can we do about it find her parents you want to find her parents you're trying to play a house where we're pretty good for nothing bums who can't even look after ourselves merry christmas happy holidays seasons greetings all of that if you don't celebrate i hope you're having a good time off from work or school i'm excited to talk about a film called tokyo godfathers today this was directed by the late satoshi cone a master honestly when it comes to anime satoshi kong was my favorite filmmaker perfect blue millennium actress tokyo godfathers the show paranoia agent and paprika showed a versatility unseen in most filmmakers he had a knack for hitchcockian suspense drama comedy this is a christmas movie for god's sakes and paprika is a cerebral science fiction film about dream technology the guy knew no bounds when it came to filmmaking his loss is a true tragedy to people who love art everywhere but i want to talk about happy things tokyo godfathers is a beautiful beautiful film this film's about three homeless people gin hana and miyuki one night during the christmas season while dumpster diving they find a baby thrown out in the trash with just a handful of clues pointing them to this baby's parents they set off on an adventure to find them christmas-themed anime is rare and tokyo godfathers is probably my favorite there's not that many and this is easily the best of the bunch for me this film is not just heartwarming it's very realistic the film doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the depiction of three homeless people who are trying to do something that's pretty much impossible each of these characters are fleshed out considerably gin is a former bicyclist who fell into alcoholism and gambling hannah is a trans woman who dreams of being a mother and sees this baby as a blessing and so for her it's really difficult that they're on a journey to find the baby's parents because this is what she's always wanted and the fact that she found this baby on christmas seems like it was destined but she also knows that she has a responsibility to get this baby to its real parents unless of course her real parents really did just dump her in the trash which provides some really great arguments amongst the three of them throughout the film because they all have different viewpoints about what should happen to this child even though they all have the same goal miyuki is a younger girl who's run away from home after a violent altercation with her father so none of them are related and they don't really have that much in common except for the fact that they're homeless something over the course of all of their lives has led them to get away from society and for this reason they have a family unit it's a dysfunctional family it's certainly not a traditional family but it's the family that's going to save this baby's life on christmas the film also deals with coincidences a lot for instance they find a very large man trapped underneath his car because he forgot to put the parking brake on and he's trying to keep this car from crushing him after helping him out of the situation it turns out that he's a yakuza boss which leads them to an extravagant party where they can eat a ton of food get access to things that are extremely necessary for this baby to survive as well as get in the middle of a hostage situation which wouldn't have happened had they not run into a crime boss this leads miyuki to a house where the baby can be breastfed and this is early in the film i'm not going to get into any spoilers for those who have not seen tokyo godfathers but the film continues with series of events that feel coincidental that feels sort of like movie logic and that i would say well that's not gonna happen in real life if the entire film wasn't about christmas miracles you can tell that satoshi cone perhaps wanted to make a film about coincidences and chose a christmas-themed narrative to strengthen that because that's one of the few things in films where you can kind of be like all right they're doing a christmas miracle thing just deal with it it's heartwarming and it makes you feel good just let it happen the film is also really funny these three characters have excellent banter with one another and they're extremely likable and again i must reiterate that they're all so fleshed out it's easy to understand why they're in this position and it's easy to comprehend why they all fled their former lives as is similar with all satoshi kone work the film is animated gorgeously the characters are so expressive and instantly recognizable as part of satoshi kon's filmography i also love how there's a few moments in the film where it seems like a christmas miracle is taking place someone shows up wearing a angel costume and they appear to be glowing but later you realize that's not exactly the case so there's moments in the film that play with your perception of a christmas miracle or if someone nice is just helping someone out and the film also doesn't backpedal from showing what is a daily occurrence for many homeless people when a group of kids beat gen up and even drag the body of a dead homeless man out of a tent which is actually really disturbing and where other films might show those kids in handcuffs later because they're being reprimanded for what they did this film does not give those characters any repercussions because that's an everyday occurrence for many homeless people satoshi cone was in every way ahead of his time it is a true tragedy that he died as early as he did and i often just dream about what else he could have made but tokyo godfather stands as an excellent anime film and a really fun christmas movie if you've never seen it i would recommend it highly i'm gonna give tokyo godfathers an a guys thank you so much as always for watching i hope you guys have a really great holiday if you missed my review for jingle all the way a considerably different christmas movie that one's on my channel right now and i hope you check it out guys thank you again for watching have a great rest of your year and as always if

"""https://youtu.be/D2AjToBel_Y""",Wonder Woman 1984,wonder woman 1984 was once again directed by patty jenkins and it was also co-written by her this time around she hasn't had a writing credit since 2003's excellent film monster so it was cool to see her take on a lot more control this time and i was very curious to see how that would go gal gadot returns once again as diana prince and this time around pedro pascal plays maxwell lord an oil baron who's losing all of his money and resources and when he comes across the ability to grant a bunch of wishes he begins to endanger the world meanwhile kristen wiig plays barbara minerva a shy timid woman who wishes to not be shy or timid and chris pine is back as steve trevor even though he died in the last movie and this film takes place many decades later so something weird is clearly going on i love the first film by patty jenkins i think she brought a lot of heart a lot of energy to that movie it was action packed it was absolutely thrilling it surprised me so much because i didn't know if a wonder woman movie was going to work and she really knocked it out of the park i couldn't wait to see what she would do with the sequel and i fully 100 trusted her i actually got a screener link for this movie like four days ago and i watched it then i could have reviewed it before christmas before it dropped on hbo max and i just didn't want to because i realized that i had so much i wanted to talk about and all of them involved spoilers and i didn't want to make another surface level review where i try to dance around subjects that i really want to discuss because i have unfortunately quite a bit of issues with wonder woman 1984. i found this movie to be a massive letdown and extremely disappointing even though there are certainly good things in the film and it's not by any means a disaster of a terrible movie but i i just didn't like it and i it pains me to say that i really really wanted to love this movie but i thought it was pretty bad since it has dropped on hbo max yesterday on christmas day and since anyone with an hbo max account has access to this movie i am going to talk about spoilers so if you don't want to know about spoilers i've already expressed my disappointment in the film if you still want to see the movie and you do you can come back and watch the rest of this review for all of those who have seen the movie let's talk about why this film didn't work for me the film opens with what is my favorite sequence in the entire film where you see a young diana in themyscira training in an olympic games of sorts hans zimmer's music is easily one of the highlights of the whole movie especially during this sequence it's one of the few things that i think is actually an improvement on the first film in this sequence diana takes a shortcut she discovers that if she slides down this dirt pit that she can get ahead of all the other competitors and when she's at the finish line robin wright stops her and says you cheated you took a shortcut that's not allowed and diana's naturally she's very upset about this i kept expecting that theme to come back into play throughout the movie that there would be a reason for this opening beyond just introducing the golden warrior that becomes armor that she wears near the end of the film but that theme that's introduced there that diana might cheat or take a shortcut to get to something she wants is only briefly explored in her wish on the dreamstone to bring steve trevor back to life that in a way she's trying to cheat death or take a shortcut to having love again and that it's just not going to work out and that it's not fair that's the best connection that i can make between the opening scene and the rest of the movie and even that feels kind of flimsy it doesn't really feel that earned and i feel like i'm reaching to establish that connection but that sequence was very thrilling and were immediately thrown into 1984 and we see wonder woman stop a heist at a mall and this felt very richard donner very sam raimi-esque extremely light very fun and welcoming i loved how the little girl was so impressed with wonder woman and i just was like this is gonna be [ __ ] great this is gonna be fun this is gonna feel like a movie that doesn't just take place in the 80s but was actually made in the 80s with updated technology the first 20 minutes of this movie had a really good time right around the time where they introduced kristen wiig's character and this is not meant to be a bash at her it's it's more so the script the film just kind of halts the pacing starts to drag considerably and we're introduced to a character that's very much like jim carrey's the riddler and batman forever or jamie foxx's electro an amazing spider-man 2 a bumbling neglected employee of a company that doesn't yet realize how smart and essential they are they bump into people they have no confidence but something along the way is going to give them confidence and it might just be super villainy i found this to be an extreme cliche and trope of some of the more cheesy superhero films we've gotten in the past and i didn't like it i it wasn't like oh they're doing that it was like wow they're doing that but when this dreamstone is introduced and pedro pascal wants it and diana wants it and everybody makes a wish on it it became clear to me that the film's narrative was going to be surrounding this object and that pretty much anything that could happen would happen which is basically how things go which is one of the laziest ways to tell a story you have a device that just grants anything it's not like a genie that gives you three wishes it's like a rock that anyone gets to wish on and it's so convoluted and so messy that things build to a point of utter chaos which obviously was the point be careful what you wish for is a theme that has been explored for a very long time and this is no different because all the characters want something and for each and every one of them it goes in a negative path and that was obvious from the start so barbara wishes to be like diana she doesn't realize that's going to give her a lot of powers and abilities diana wishes to have steve trevor back and maxwell lord wishes to become the dream stone and the thing evaporates and now anyone who touches him can make a wish through him so he tries to go around the world to people of power and politics and business and create this empire for himself in which he has control over the populace even though his young son just wants to hang out with him so his son gets thrown to the side and he's also deteriorating his health is deteriorating his body so they discover that you can get your wish granted but it takes something away from you so let's talk about steve trevor because this is easily one of the strangest story lines in the film he's brought back because diana made this wish but he he's not brought back in his own body he's brought back in the body of a random man who lives near diana he just approaches her at a party and she's like i don't have any idea who you are why are you talking to me you [ __ ] creep and he's like no it's me steve then he magically turns into chris pine and i was so [ __ ] confused i felt nothing there was no emotional connection i had so many questions later on you realize that the film is simply showing us chris pine like for our benefit even though to everyone else including diana he looks like someone credited as handsome man this actor is commonly seen in a lot of hallmark christmas movies which is probably why there's a cheesy hallmark christmas ending with him and that's beautiful i guess if you're a hallmark christmas movie fan nothing against you but i certainly haven't seen any of them i just thought that that was a funny comparison and i wanted to bring it up in this review of wonder woman 1984 on youtube.com so throughout the whole movie whenever diana and steve were doing things including sleeping together i couldn't help but think this random guy has just been plucked out of his life does he have family does he have kids does he have a significant other you know like is he losing his job right now is he about to get fired because he hasn't showed up to work in like a week what's going on with this guy that's just been snatched out of existence and made into steve trevor that was so strange to me and i could not stop thinking about it and even weirder is that the things that maxwell lord wishes for are insane walls appear out of nowhere nuclear weapons are fired people are killed by heart attacks instantly why can't steve trevor just come back as steve trevor why does he have to be put into a random guy that just makes no [ __ ] sense man now i love me some horror films but they really went ahead and had an expert come in for a scene explain the backstory and then he was like bye i'm done i've served my purpose the other thing about the film that was strange to me is the action or should i say lack of action a hundred minutes into the movie i paused it and i realized that there had been two scenes with wonder woman like in her outfit fighting crime kicking ass two scenes in a hundred minutes there's nothing in this film as thrilling as the training sequence in the first film or the no man's land scene or that incredible siege on that village with the sniper nothing in the film ever reaches those thrilling heights there's the mall sequence early on where she foils a robbery which half of that has been officially released online as a clip and then there's a pretty cool chase scene involving a bunch of trucks on a road and wonder woman is just [ __ ] throwing those things everywhere and that's really exciting but for the most part the pacing in the film is awful now one of the things that diana loses because of her wish being granted is some of her abilities so bullets start to have an effect on her she feels weaker in battle she can't do the things that she normally can do it's not like her powers are completely gone though they're kind of like at half or something she can still kick a truck in the air and use her lasso of truth which never really makes anyone tell the truth in this movie it's sort of just used for other things throughout the whole film and it it kind of just became like a magical do everything rope but i was thinking about superman 2 and that film clark gives up his powers so that he can be with lois and i was thinking about spider-man 2 and that film peter starts to lose his abilities because he's just too stressed in life and he's not doing what he wants to do he's not with the woman he loves his powers are leaving him because he doesn't feel like spider-man so even though this film exploring those themes felt familiar i understood the end goal that the goal is the scene where they get their powers back and it's really exciting like that's seen in superman 2 where he kicks the guy's ass at the bar who is being a dick or in spider-man 2 where he goes to face doc ock leading to one of the best [ __ ] action scenes ever in a comic book movie and this film has a similar moment where wonder woman figures out how to fly after finally giving up and steve like relinquishes the fact that he's there and she says i revoke my wish or whatever and now she can fly so that's cool she learned how to fly and it's inspiring and stuff but like i just i didn't feel anything i i felt nothing because the narrative didn't make sense there's so many wishes constantly happening throughout the movie it's like in dragon ball z like if they can summon shenron every five minutes or something and nothing builds to to anything that really makes sense meanwhile kristen wiig is turning into a [ __ ] cat so barbara's arc is accentuated by the fact that at one point she could not walk in heels and now uh she she can walk in heels so that's uh visual storytelling i guess she can walk in heels now so she is cheetah oh boy so let's talk about cheetah for a second her first close-up was hilarious i actually went oh my god like to my friend we were it was it was distressing um is she a jellicle cat though that's what i want to know this fight was atrocious it was ugly looking it was made to look low light i'm assuming to mask the cgi to make it look a little more realistic but it looked very bad and you could tell that cheetah was put in this film so wonder woman could have a physical fight with something because she's not gonna fight maxwell lord unless he manifests [ __ ] robot arms or something stupid and so like the finale with him was all emotional she lassoed his leg and was able to reach out to the populace and tell all of these people that had begun to make wishes through maxwell because he finds out that using the particles that are coming out of these goddamn tvs will touch people touching him and then they can ask for anything they want so she pulls a mr satan at the end of dragon ball z convincing the entire populist to give goku spirit energy and uh keeps everybody from from doing the unthinkable somehow everyone i guess revoked their wish and um there were like nuclear weapons in the air like every [ __ ] country was about to nuke each other and you see the politicians and the people who are working at the military bases who are like freaking the [ __ ] out and then all of the missiles disappear as the people revoke their wishes and all the bad stuff goes away and then you see and this was very concerning to me plot wise you see these politicians they actually say like the nuclear missiles are disappearing we have missiles disappearing sir yesterday are vanishing from our screen indicating that their memories aren't wiped of these events it's not like relinquishing the wish took away the physical wish it did not take away everyone's memory of the event meaning that does everyone in 1984 remember that weird day where 10 million dollars manifested in people's living rooms and nuclear warheads were in the sky and russia was about to nuke america and america was about to nuke russia and does everyone just [ __ ] remember this because it seems like that's like a major thing that might have happened now i'm willing to buy what occurs at the end of superman because his ability to interfere with human history is established early on as a rule he cannot break and because the memories of those involved are wiped and because it was 1978 so maxwell is now running on the streets looking for his son who he magically finds coming out of the trees and they can have like a movie moment where they hug and it's heartwarming and the film isn't exactly concrete on whether or not maxwell suffers any consequences for nearly destroying the entire planet despite kristen wiig and pedro pascal being excellent actors their characters are very reminiscent of what you might have seen in a batman forever or an amazing spider-man too it just feels so over the top and hammy and unearned it doesn't feel lovingly hammy it feels accidentally cheesy you know what i mean and the film's pacing is just bad it's a boring movie for a good chunk of the second act if diana wasn't wonder woman for all that time but the film was compelling and the narrative was interesting that would be completely different it's why i love watching spider-man 2 even though he's not spider-man for a large chunk of the second act or look at a film like dark knight rises he's not batman that much in that movie but it had compelling things in it it was investing as a narrative a movie like this needs to have more than just a magic rock that disappears inside an oil tycoon guy [ __ ] also the after credit scene introduces linda carter uh as asteria i guess and she she looks into the lens and breaks the fourth wall i can't remember if she winked but she looks right at us and says like i've been doing this for a long time or something along those lines and you know i smiled i used to watch the wonder woman show when i was a kid but i just couldn't help but think about like what this would have been in like a hulk movie like remember the first incredible hulk when lou ferrigno and stan lee walked by and i was like oh [ __ ] there's lou ferrigno and stan lee but they were just like in the background they just kind of like walked by like imagine if the the end credits scene of of the incredible hulk was like lou ferrigno saves somebody's life by like lifting up a car and then looks at the screen and goes i've been doing this for a long time like that that was a bad idea look i get that some will enjoy this movie i really wanted to be one of those people but i just don't think it's good i think that if you like this movie i really really am happy for you but i didn't i think it could have been a lot better and i'm still very excited to see what patty jenkins does i think she's a phenomenal filmmaker she's so so talented she's such an excellent director but the script for this movie really needed a lot more work i'm going to give wonder woman 1984 a c minus guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon including my best of the year list which is kind of like the best movies of the worst year there really aren't that much to choose from uh a lot of things got pushed back but gratefully indie movies as usual kind of saved this year's ass there's some really good indie stuff i'm excited to talk about i've been catching up on a lot of things i missed over the past few weeks and i'm excited to talk about those thank you so much guys for watching and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized ,0

works let's go is there a problem officer arnold schwarzenegger sinbad i work for the post office and i'm unstable tell him this man is totally insane thank you christmas comes but once a year jingle all the way you picked the wrong day it's time to talk about a film that i've wanted to talk about on this channel for a minute jingle all the way it had to happen eventually today's the day and since a lot of you probably want to know what the rest of this shirt says i saw jingle all the way in a theater with my mom in 1996 i was only 8 years old and i had a blast it was never really the repeating christmas themed movie for me though as a kid because i really didn't watch that many christmas movies home alone was sort of the staple jingle all the way i watched every once in a while after that but as i got older strangely i found myself enjoying the film a lot more and it's mostly because i looked at it from the lens of an adult jingle all the way is that rare family themed christmas movie that isn't really aimed at kids it's actually aimed at adults yes somebody gets kicked in the groin it's about toys and it has power rangers references but this is actually a movie that adults are going to understand a lot more than kids arnold schwarzenegger plays a business man who never has any time for his family and his kid played by jake lloyd before he got his anakin role in phantom menace really wants a turbo man doll for christmas the problem is that turboman dolls are sold out everywhere this year this is being echoed with ps5s which i still don't have and that's okay now his wife played by rita wilson knew that their kid wanted a turbo man doll weeks ago and she reminded him to get the goddamn thing then and he still hasn't he realizes that he has to run out on christmas eve and find one of the hardest to get items that's available because if he doesn't his kid's gonna hate him turns out sinbad is also looking for the same toy for his son and these two men wage all-out war on christmas eve to try to find the turbo man doll jingle all the way was met with pretty negative reviews upon release and home alone despite being the highest grossing movie of 1990 didn't get much better reviews actually it's only been in years recently that the film has taken its rightful status as a holiday classic jingle all the way probably will never get there but people from my generation really  like this movie and i'm one of those people and it's not just because it's fun and silly and it reminds me of a warm-hearted time in my life when there wasn't as many issues to worry about when the world seems simpler it's not just that that certainly is the icing on the top of the cake but the reason i like jingle all the way is because as an adult as someone who has now gone around and last minute try to find gifts for loved ones i kind of understand the movie now i view the movie through the lens of satire which is not something i understood as a kid and a lot of people don't really pay attention to it in the film and yeah there's absolutely elements of this movie that are slapstick heavy very corny and melodramatic but what i love about jingle all the way which is funny to say i know it's  jingle all the way i don't give a i love this movie is that it's a family christmas movie that's completely honest about what family christmases tend to be like it's not always warm hugs and happy fireplace meals with warm music and santa it's generally kids who want a toy and a parent who's losing their mind trying to find it and what length someone will go to to find some people are trampled in this movie as people cram into stores trying to find these toys it's a very honest christmas movie despite arnold in a jet pack zooming around towards the end dressed up as turbo man it's a film that shows a post office worker pretend to have a bomb because he believes that inside this radio station is a turbo man doll now you can look at that as absurdist humor and laugh when the cop gets blown up real good but in reality this is a movie that is poking fun at the lengths we'll go to to please our children and keep them happy the film's message of commercialism and greed is unmistakable i mean you have a scene where arnold is trying so hard to get this goddamn toy that he follows jim belushi as santa claus to a warehouse filled with other santa clauses who are making cheap knock-off toys to try to profit off of what children really want and he's willing to shell out 300 for what ends up being a fake turbo man broken in the package which leads to a hilarious brawl between santa elves and arnold schwarzenegger how can you not enjoy that at the same time though this movie does not give a about christmas which is really fun to watch but i like that the film is honest when's the last time you saw a christmas film that has a bunch of fake santa clauses profiting off of the hopes and dreams of children which led to some of the biggest criticisms of the film upon release if you go back and read some of the early reviews roger ebert gave it two and a half out of four stars and he enjoyed the film but he was depressed quote depressed by the rampant commercialism in the film how everyone was treating each other poorly and he wanted to feel better leaving the theater about the future generation of kids and what they wanted out of a holiday totally get that that's kind of what the film is saying sure it's funny to watch arnie crawl through a chuck e cheese discovery zone style playhouse jumping into a pit of balls and grabbing a child's face because he wants to do everything he can to get that damn doll for his kid sure all that's funny and kids will laugh at that but the movie also has booster the sidekick to turbo man that nobody likes there's booster action figures available everywhere nobody wants him even the guy dressed up as booster in the parade gets his ass kicked by a bunch of kids because nobody likes booster everybody wants the turbo man it's great it's uh it's a silly movie it is it's really not all of it holds up especially the special effects towards the end with arnold zooming around in his jet pack it's very cheesy looking and that's okay it kind of makes me laugh more and makes me nostalgic i don't give a um something else this movie has that a lot of films of the era don't especially family fair is phil hartman rest in peace as a single dad who's going around town trying to bang every woman in sight every woman in town likes the fact that he's very handy he goes around to their houses fixes stuff and he's trying to move in on rita wilson throughout the entire film when's the last time you saw a 90s villain in a kids movie who's possibly a serial predator put that cookie down now jingle all the way is a very entertaining movie for me it's fast paced all the way through i've always really enjoyed it i find it very funny i think arnold's really likable in the movie as is sinbad they play off each other very well and i like the fact that sinbad you can't really nail him down as a character there's times where he's a villain there's times where he's a friend he shifts he will punch arnold in the face to try to get to the turbo man but later he'll find him at a coffee shop or a bar and just sit down next to him and talk and so it seems strange in the moment until you realize what the film is saying is that as soon as that thing they want appears all bets are off i really like jingle all the way and i have a blast every time i watch it i'm gonna give jingle all the way a b-plus certainly nowhere near as good as other holiday classics and i understand if you don't like the film but for my money it's a movie i like to watch every december guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuckmanized ,1
"""https://youtu.be/-AqqW2L15pY""",Greenland,greenland stars gerard butler and is yet again another attempt for him at a disaster film his last one geostorm was bad this comes from the director of angel has fallen as well as shot caller a comet is hurtling toward earth and originally scientists believe that it's just kind of going to pass by some fragments might burn up in the atmosphere but eventually those fragments chip away and endanger the lives of almost everyone on the planet so gerard butler and his family are trying to flee to safety when i sat down to watch this movie i didn't really think i was going to be in for any type of high art i just wanted to watch a fun disposable disaster film i was thinking about movies like armageddon or the day after tomorrow and surprisingly the film is more serious than i expected it to be and not really in a hammy way a lot of it is because the film is actually mid-budget range and you don't get that that much at all anymore in fact that's very rare i immediately like that about the film you don't get a lot of mid-budget range movies anymore everything's either a 5 million horror film or a [ __ ] marvel movie the fact that this movie was made for i don't know what 30 40 million dollars whatever it is it allowed them to do more things with character while also having a lot of cgi spectacle but the film chooses not to focus that much on it and i don't think it's just because of budget reasons they focus heavily on character in greenland and and for that reason the movie is a lot better than i thought it was going to be i still have a lot of issues with the film and most of them are towards the last half the setup for the film is really where the strengths lie i liked that instead of seeing the first impact in some grand wide shot where you're actually placed at the city like the cameras in the city where the first impact happens you see it from the perspective of a family that's actually watching it on the news and because of that you feel the reaction in the room you stay with this family for the whole movie and so you don't really go away to a military room where a bunch of people are pressing buttons and things you don't understand and waving forms around and walking down hallways really fast you stay with the family the whole time you don't go to other countries where random people you don't know are running away from explosions or tidal waves you stay with the family and so you always get their perspective and for that reason it puts it above other disaster movies for me the first half of the film was surprisingly effective it's mostly handheld and so it does feel pretty intense there's actually a lot of tension towards the last half though things get a bit repetitive there's only so many ways that the family can be separated and have to find each other again there's only so many times somebody can hitchhike and try to get a ride someplace that starts to get old pretty fast and once we get to the inevitable conclusion which don't worry won't get into yeah i don't know it all just feels sort of like yeah that was gonna happen and that's that's how it happened so it happened you know it doesn't really feel like there's any surprises it's just a very serviceable movie that has a surprisingly effective setup the one thing that i will say going into the film i had no idea what it's about i thought it was going to be absurd i thought it was going to be like day after tomorrow times 10. so i thought it was actually about an asteroid the size of greenland hurtling towards earth which i i kind of wish that's what it was still though after this crazy year we've had there were a few scenes that hit differently than they would have there's a scene with a first responder like a doctor or a nurse they don't really clarify who provides the characters with some very important medicine for their son and i remember just thinking damn like that just that hits differently this year because we've seen so many healthcare professionals risking their lives and doing crazy awesome things and dealing with a lot of persecution this year and i don't know that scene was just really heartwarming and it probably never would have been if it hadn't been for for this crazy [ __ ] year also i have to say the kid in the movie is smart he doesn't do stupid [ __ ] and when he's in peril you believe it it doesn't feel set up it doesn't feel like he's just like being a kid actor you know he's really good in the film but he makes choices we were like good job kid like you did a good [ __ ] thing you know a lot of times in movies the writer uses the kid to make things happen because the kid is inexperienced or the kid is stupid and they think well the kid will do this dumb choice and that will lead to some tension not here the writing for the kid is actually really smart overall this movie surprised me is it great no it's got a lot of structural issues for the last half and it gets very repetitive and there's basically no surprises but i like that the movie did not rely on cgi and it actually focuses on the family for the most part which heightened the tension for me i'm gonna give greenland a b-minus guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized you ,1
"""https://youtu.be/3zGa4m4M8dw""",Promising Young Woman,promising young woman is directed by emerald fennel this is her first film and it stars carrie mulligan as a woman who is on the hunt a tragic event happened to her in the past and she has taken it upon herself to search out people that she could potentially teach a lesson to in a way i'm not going to tell you what she does or how she does it but soon this path gets very dark as she meets a young man played by bo burnham they start to fall in love and this lifestyle she has been leading gets in the way of that carrie mulligan easily gives one of her best performances if not maybe my favorite performance i've ever seen from her in this film she is very funny extremely frightening and she has found a perfect balance between someone who is very very emotional about one specific thing that she cares about deeply but she hides it she doesn't want to show that to anyone and we know from frame one how important it is to her because she is that good it's really really hard for an actor to embody someone that's supposed to be carrying this weight this gigantic ton of bricks on their shoulders of emotional baggage but also play a character that doesn't want to show any emotion it's really really great whenever an actor can pull that off and and carrie mulligan is fan-fucking-tastic in this movie i also love the look of the film the colors really pop it's like candy everything has this sweet glossy vibe to it despite the dark subject matter since the film is not out right now i don't want to give you too many details but the film is very unpredictable there's times where i felt like i knew exactly where the movie was going and it would go in a different direction they often use roman numerals to signify when something important is about to happen and you start to anticipate something whenever you see a new number added to the screen there's a lot of i guess glorified cameos not not really cameos there's a lot of bit parts from well-known actors specifically alfred molina is excellent in just a handful of moments he's really really good in the film the film was a little tonally inconsistent but in a way that wasn't too bothersome for instance in one scene the characters are in a pharmacy dancing to paris hilton and in another you're hearing about the darkest and most horrific thing that could happen to somebody and it's painful and it makes you extremely mad and then in another scene there'll be an orchestral version of britney spears toxic the film definitely swings for the fences and most of the time it connects except for the last 10 minutes i really will not get into anything don't worry the film isn't out and i certainly would not want to ruin that for the filmmakers but damn it's a tough final 10 minutes i don't really know how i feel about it because i completely understand the point that's being made it's a very uh  how do i even hmm but it wanted me to feel a certain way especially with the music choices and i just didn't feel that way the rest of the film felt a certain way and it seemed to exist in a slightly hyper stylized world very candy-coated and then all of a sudden it doesn't and i get it it just left me kind of like oh okay for some viewers that ending is going to make or break the film uh for me i liked parts of it a lot especially just how god damn i really can't talk about it  to sum it up i loved 80 of this movie and then i didn't i got it it made sense i understood exactly what she was saying i just didn't feel the way she wanted me to feel i'm gonna give promising young woman a b-plus guys thank you so much as always for watching but i also want to give a big thank you to the sponsor for this video blinkist blinkist has over 3 000 non-fiction books and these books have been condensed into 15-minute increments so that you can really soak up all of the knowledge that the book has if you don't have the time to read a lot of these non-fiction books that are meant to teach you all different kinds of things but a lot of us are on the go nowadays which is why something like blinkist is very convenient you can read them or listen to them podcast style one book i'd recommend is two pixar and beyond written by lawrence levy my unlikely journey with steve jobs to make entertainment history or shoot for the moon written by james donovan the space race and the extraordinary voyage of apollo 11. the first 100 people to go to blinkist.com stuckman will get a week of it for free and if you decide to sign up for a full membership you'll get 25 off so please do check out that link in the description below that's blinkist.com stuckman thank you so much to them for sponsoring this video and thank you guys for watching as always if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized you ,1
"""https://youtu.be/ccRC-IcIMRc""",Run,run is directed by aneesh chaganti the man behind the excellent film searching which if you haven't seen you really should it's really damn good this film premiered this weekend on hulu it was originally gonna come out back in mother's day they had this whole great marketing campaign surrounding the creepy weird mother in this movie and mother's day that of course had to be scrapped due to the pandemic but now we're getting a chance to see it this film tells the story of a young girl who begins to suspect that her caring mother might be harboring a dark secret she starts to notice some concerning irregularities with the way her mom acts she doesn't want her to be on the internet at night she doesn't want her to make too many phone calls unless she's in the room there's things about the medicine she's taking that's starting to weird her out and pretty soon things get really [ __ ] up i had a great time with ron when i think of a thriller this is the type of story i think of it's bare bones it's very simple it's a young girl in a wheelchair who realizes that she is trapped in a lot of ways emotionally and physically now how are you going to get out of that situation and we get to watch that play out over 90 minutes incredibly tense minutes minutes that are edited so well and shot so well that my ocd was pleased if you saw searching you know that giganti has a great eye for detail that was a very unconventional film this film is told very traditionally and classically it feels very much like a hitchcock movie there are aspects of it that reminded me of misery there are aspects of it that reminded me of rear windows specifically the christopher reeve rear window the tv movie from 1998 down to the fact that they cast young kira allen in this film this adds a layer of authenticity to her performance that would not have been captured had they hired an actor who doesn't know what that's like day in and day out kira allen does and so she brought a lot to this role when she's crawling through the hallways when she doesn't have use of her wheelchair it feels extremely painful because you know that she is struggling to do it she gives one of my favorite performances that i've seen so far in 2020. i think she's really really good in this movie and i would love to see her do more stuff she plays off sarah paulson very well who loves playing horrible people god damn miss polson but she's really good at it like all great talents she has a way of making scripted dialogue feel unscripted the last time i saw a film that attempted to be a straightforward thriller and nothing else was unhinged with russell crowe and he's great in that movie but the movie itself was just kind of fine it was a kind of disposable throwaway movie this film is skillfully made and extremely well acted from top to bottom and the simplicity only helps boost the suspense there are sequences throughout the movie that i just was really on the edge and it was mostly just because you're constantly in a state of panic wondering if this girl can pull something off as she starts to uncover the truth about the life that she's living and i won't ruin it for you but it's really thrilling to watch the film absolutely has some movie logic there are some things that happen that probably would not happen in real life but they have to happen for the movie to play out in the way that they would like it to there's newspaper articles and imperative information that the majority of people would probably not keep in their house but they happen to be in this house these things are necessary when you're trying to tell a story that has virtually no exposition when you're trying to tell a story where no one really learns anything by being told and you have to visually explain everything to the audience which is how i prefer to watch a movie that's extremely difficult when you get to a part of the story that does have some heavy backstory and most films do rely on things like newspaper clippings or internet articles or a news broadcast to get this point across and there are a few sequences in run that strain credibility a little bit there's a few i don't necessarily want to call them plot holes but there's moments where upon reflection you can think about some events that took place and wonder would that have really happened that way but i didn't find myself thinking about those things while i watched the movie because it was so skillfully made there are some films that have a few key plot points like arlington road for instance that are so well made but there's that one plot point where you're like hmm i don't know it happens and i think for most viewers it's just going to come down to whether or not you care to nitpick every single thing about a skillfully made thriller like this which for me is probably my favorite thriller that i've seen in recent memory i'm going to give run an a minus i think anish giganti is one of the best new directors we have searching was as i said a very unconventional film told in a very unique and different way this i imagine was probably a breath of fresh air to approach a more traditional filmmaking perspective and i think he knocked it out of the park i can't wait to see what else he does but also kyra allen holy [ __ ] like what a great performance

"""https://youtu.be/N9ZFzdeTjtw""",The Craft: Legacy,the craft legacy was written and directed by zoe lister jones and according to the imdb synopsis is in fact a sequel to the 1996 film the craft which i just recently reviewed in the eighth annual halloween special i'm a fan of that movie there's things about it that i had problems with things about it that i was hoping this film would address and i wasn't entirely sure if this movie was going to be a straightforward reboot soft reboot an actual sequel or something else entirely in the case of the craft legacy technically on paper yes this is a sequel but in many ways it's a soft reboot this film also follows a young girl who's come to a school she's never been to before she has abilities she's been keeping secret and she meets three other young women who also have abilities that they're keeping secret and they form a coven if you saw my review of the first film you know i really enjoy it i have a lot of nostalgia for it that movie is the 1990s exploding all over the screen as far as i'm concerned the music the fashion choices the snide insults that movie felt like it captured a part of my life on screen even though i have some issues with the movie and so i was simultaneously really excited but also very concerned about this film it is coming from blumhouse their attempts at remaking properties or doing sequels to horror films many years later have not always worked for me in fact more often than not they haven't worked for me and unfortunately the craft legacy is yet another film that didn't work for me there are things about this movie that i like and i'd like to talk about those first i think kaylee spaney is really terrific in this movie she was giving off major audrey hepburn vibes i really want to see her do more work my man david duchovny's in the film and i haven't seen him in anything in a long time so it was refreshing to see him back in something and i also like some of the ways the girls use their powers early on in the film for one there's a bully at school who's extremely mean and very over the top and sometimes a bit far-fetched but they use a spell on him and he suddenly becomes super woke and wants to talk about gender politics and all of these things that he had no interest in before and i thought that was really clever besides that i think a lot of this film just doesn't work and much of it has to do with the characterization and unfortunately i'm going to compare it a lot to the 1996 film it's it's inescapable like i talked about in my review for that movie every single character was fleshed out every girl had something going on in their lives one of them was dealing with a racist bully the other had scarring and had to go through these really painful medical procedures one had an abusive stepfather and a family life in a trailer park that was awful and our lead was a new girl at a catholic school who lost her mother and has no idea what she's doing in her life and so all of those characters coming together they had motivation they had real concrete reasons for wanting to get out of their lives and embrace something like witchcraft to try to do that and all those characters i think are one of the biggest reasons that the craft has a cult following all these years later because people just love those characters in this movie there is virtually no attempt to give character to the three girls our lead gets a ton of it she's the person we see everything through we experience everything through her eyes the other three girls nothing and i mean nothing zip there is no attempt to characterize any of them i know nothing about the characters at all which is a major disappointment and by far my biggest issue with this movie this film felt like blumhouse's attempt at making a superhero movie because it treats the witchcraft like superpowers their motivation is non-existent the reason that they want to have these abilities is because it would just be really nice and when you don't know what the motivation of your characters are it's tough to care about them it's tough to want to follow them on a journey the other issue with the movie is that certain things that changes made the movie worse the first film took place in a catholic school and so there was this interesting contrast where all these girls are in this environment that's supposed to be very godly and extremely strict and yet they're practicing this satanic stuff it was this great contrast to everything else that was happening around them this film it's just a regular old school and all the teachers are bored and what do you [ __ ] do all the aspects of the original 1996 film that felt a little more religious or like they were talking more about the dark arts were taken away in this film there is no magic store or the woman who works there with the book and sort of warns them about spells and getting too close to things that could potentially be harmful to them they have a book in the movie and they seem to just magically know how to do everything once the four girls meet in the film before you know it they're doing insane witchcraft one of them is using her fingers like it's a lighter creating fire out of her hands there's a montage sequence in which all of them experiment with their powers and that's it the light is a feather stiff as a board scene from the original film is included in that montage for like a couple shots and it's over in a second and so we're sort of denied the fun of watching these girls discover how cool it is that they have all these abilities it's just sort of brushed away really quick that's another issue i had with the film is that the witchcraft elements are very minimal for the most part this movie is actually a domestic thriller because michelle monaghan plays their lead character's mother and she has a new boyfriend played by david duchovny and they're going to go live with him and he has three sons and nobody really gets along and that's really the focus of the movie and that's fine if you want to make a film that has supernatural elements but it's really about something else i mean that's what all the best horror movies are but the film doesn't have enough of the supernatural stuff and so it relies on multiple dream sequences a sequence where the main character wakes up and finds one of her stepbrothers sleepwalking into her room which is never explained she often gets visions of snakes and knives and eyes and it doesn't feel like there's much of a resolution for those visions either there's multiple loose ends when the film concludes the last 15 minutes of the movie take a major nose dive in regards to storytelling structure there's so many things left hanging when the film concludes that i actually my jaw kind of dropped there were so many story lines that were not resolved it felt as if there must be a director's cut here somewhere it felt like massive chunks of this movie have got to be on the cutting room floor and during those last 15 minutes the film introduces some of the worst special effects that i've seen in a big budget movie in years there's some very subpar cgi in this movie and i don't know if it had to do with the fact that this film was being edited during this pandemic and maybe they weren't able to complete it in the way they had envisioned i don't know i have no idea because it honestly seems look i have to talk spoilers i'm going to be honest if you haven't seen the craft legacy i really have some things i'd like to discuss so that's your warning it is out now i waited until the film was out to review it because i do want to talk about some spoilers and let's start with that cgi i actually screamed what like i screamed i could not believe my eyes or david duchovny's eyes it was crazy i was like what was i was watching with my buddy and we were like what did it so like i said this is more of a domestic thriller than a supernatural fantasy coming-of-age film like the first one was because this film was essentially like that 2001 movie domestic disturbance with john travolta and vince vaughn except vince vaughn is a warlock it's my best way to pitch it because hannah realizes that david duchovny is a warlock and that his job which is a motivational speaker for men is sort of wrapped up into this strange cult where everyone gets together in his living room and snaps their fingers and he tells them not to be weak how do we eliminate the weakest among us so that the strongest can thrive as soon as she found a book in his library that was all about his views on masculinity i was like okay he's gonna be the villain of course he's gonna be the villain and he was and don't take this the wrong way i don't have an issue with that this isn't like oh the bad guys are man i don't care like there are tons of [ __ ] guys in the world of course so that's perfectly fine it's just that it felt very telegraphed and obvious from the beginning the major issues i have with the way the ending goes down is that they all have this battle with david duchovny as a warlock he's trying to kill hannah while the other three girls are back at their place binding themselves so that they can't do any more spells because a friend of theirs commits suicide and they think it's their fault but then they all show up and it's like an avengers meetup where they all have different colored mist around them like green and blue and red and i think yellow and they all just fight david duchovny and they kind of trap him in a terrible cgi bubble and he's like oh no i'm in a bubble it was really bad like i was truly concerned about the i was concerned and he starts talking about his master plan of course before he tries to kill any of them but eventually they overpower him and he burns alive and dies now here's where we start to run into issues because i'm talking the next scene i'm talking cut to the next [ __ ] scene they're just on the sidewalk laughing hannah's mom picks her up in the car they make a joke about how she shouldn't be looking to date warlocks and they drive away i'm like wait a second so this world famous public speaker was just burned alive in the forest was there no investigation was there not a single moment in which this girl's mother who was dating him said what happened was there what happened that's what i would like to know this is where i feel like there's got to be scenes missing from the movie there has to be there must be here's the other big loose end his three kids her step-brothers why was one of them sleepwalking there's a young boy seen throughout the movie who who seems to try to comfort her at times because he knows more than he's letting on what happened to him there's also a subplot in the movie which is perhaps the best subplot in the film actually where the guy who was bullying her originally reveals to her in secret that he's bisexual and that he hooked up with her stepbrother at one point and that stepbrother has been hiding that because his dad is this overbearing toxic person that's a great subplot and all that's just thrown away i guess everyone just accepted that he's a warlock and he burned alive in the woods i don't know it's just such a strange complete disregard for storytelling craft and in the beginning of the review i mentioned that imdb lists this as a sequel and that is technically true and that's because of the final scene hannah realizes she's adopted michelle monaghan is not her real mother and she goes to a hospital and meets farooza bulk from the first film finds out my mom is actually her as soon as i discovered that this character was adopted i knew that was the direction they were going to go and i like that unfortunately she has no lines she's just there so the coolness of seeing that character that i love from the first movie is literally just one shot and there's nothing happening in the scene it really doesn't mean much for the story unfortunately essentially they made a soft reboot of the craft and the only reason they can call it a sequel is because they have one of the actresses at the end besides that it's a soft reboot with an added storyline of domestic abuse here's something i couldn't help but notice though the ending of this movie and the events that take place in it are basically copy and pasted from blumhouse's 2019 black christmas movie at the end of that film and obviously spoilers if you haven't seen it the lead girl is taken captive by the bad guy and we reveal that it's somebody she knows in her personal life he then explains his entire master plan to the lead character before trying to kill her and then eventually all of her friends show up to save her and an avengers fight breaks out and both of the bad guys burn alive i actually couldn't believe it i was looking forward to this movie i am a fan of the first one it's nostalgic for me it's special for me and i'm not seeing too many people enjoying this movie i have a feeling that fans of the original are going to be disappointed like i was i'm to give the craft legacy a d and i also

"""https://youtu.be/21LZ_O5fgRw""",Jennifer's Body,we always share your bed when we have slumber parties jennifer's evil i know no i mean she's actually evil not high school evil jennifer's body was directed by karen kusama written by diablo cody and stars amanda seifried and megan fox and it's a story of two high school best friends who've known each other their whole lives needy played by seyfried and jennifer played by fox on one innocent night the two go to a bar to see an indie rock band called low shoulder the entire place burns down but the lead singer insists on taking jennifer with him in his creepy van and the two gets separated when jennifer shows up later that night she's covered in blood eating chicken off the floor and barfing up black liquid and soon enough she gets an appetite for human flesh jennifer's body is a very unique film in that it has gone through quite the evolution in regards to how it was received initially the film was received very poorly and there's still a lot of people who don't like this movie critics didn't like it all that much people haven't liked it all that much either i first saw it a few years ago when my wife showed it to me one of our earlier halloween specials we did called scary movie binge she wanted me to see jennifer's body i had never seen it because of that reaction sometimes when the public really hates a movie i'm like ah whatever i'll check it out anyway you know sometimes opinions differ but everybody seemed to hate this movie so i skipped it i didn't watch it until my wife suggested it and we did it for that video it was near the end of this marathon that we did it was like four or five in the [ __ ] morning we had watched all these movies and then we watched jennifer's body and we still watched i believe the orphanage after that and so after seeing jennifer's body without really being able to pay attention to it all that much i said i thought it was all right over the years i have wanted to watch the movie consistently more often since then i've seen it three times i've watched the feature commentary i've shown it to friends i've watched it again on my own and i've really come to love this movie i think that it's massively misunderstood and extremely mismarketed 20th century fox and their marketing department decided to rely entirely on the sex appeal of megan fox she was fresh off of transformers at the time and that is all they cared about nearly every poster sold the film in that way as did the trailers the blu-ray for this movie actually has a special feature entitled megan fox is hot i'm not kidding you play it and it's essentially an anime music video montage sequence of megan fox looking sexy from the movie that's all it is and by far the most embarrassing thing the 20th century fox suggested was that megan fox appear during live streams on porn sites to promote the movie like i'm not making this [ __ ] up they completely didn't get what they had with jennifer's body and they ruined this movie for a long [ __ ] time somebody was mentioning that at a test screening or you had a test group and somebody was like it needs more boobs i still have the card um so there was there was a test screening that a kid wrote they said what would you improve about this film and the kid wrote needs more boobs and spelled um boobs b-e-w-b um and that was the data that was collected and taken seriously it's been recently the film has been reevaluated more by people mostly by female critics jennifer's body is the film that 2019's black christmas wishes it was it's gorgeously directed the cinematography is actually really good i know this is strange to hear because the film has this unwarranted reputation but it's entirely because of an image that a studio constructed for this movie that it wasn't even trying to be so a lot of people went to this film expecting either a horror film only where are we going jennifer was unleashed on september 18th are you scared [Applause] or a movie where megan fox is really attractive through the whole thing this is a dark comedy diablo cody's films like juno or young adult all have a very subversive edgy bite to them and jennifer's body literally has bite but the humor is also very much so like that and if you're not on that wavelength or you don't prefer that kind of dialogue that's understandable it can be very on the nose characters refer to themselves as female healthcare products nicknames and stuff like that throughout most of the movie and sometimes that can be a little much but what i love about this movie is surprisingly megan fox is excellent she plays a character that is so tragically obsessed with her self-image that she can't even come to terms with the fact that her friend who socially is lower on the totem pole than her has a loving relationship with her boyfriend chip played by johnny simmons is smarter than her and is probably going to be more successful than her in the future the way i look at this relationship between needy and jennifer in the movie is is sort of like that high school friend that you have and then when you graduate you're starting to move on maybe you're going to college or you're getting a job or your life is starting but your friend is still kind of acting like they're in high school because they just don't want it to end that's the way i view these two characters it seems like eventually that's where things are going to go for them jennifer's body purposely takes horror tropes that we're used to seeing in movies like this and turns them around and most of it is because it is from a female perspective for instance once jennifer gets an appetite for flesh she tends to lure boys to places she takes one boy into the woods by saying hey let's go sort some stuff out and he just follows her she does the same thing with another boy and he just goes along with it when she invites one boy to what he thinks is her house it ends up being on an undeveloped street filled with houses that have no residence yet leading him to an unoccupied house with a light on upstairs and he just willingly goes inside because he thinks he's about to get some if you just flip that for any other horror film no girl would ever convincingly just follow some guy into the woods twice or into a weird abandoned house because jennifer's victims don't view her as a threat because she's a girl and because they want to have sex that's really [ __ ] clever something else the film did and it's a bit of a similar statement that the movie cherry falls made cherry falls was a not that great slasher movie that actually never had a theatrical release and eventually went to the usa network starring the late great brittany murphy in that movie the killer was going after virgins only so everybody in the school is like we need to [ __ ] right now to save our lives which goes completely against every horror movie ever where the people who are having sex regularly are usually the people to die first it was sort of this old ingrained message that premarital sex is bad and if you do it you're going to die and this film has a similar theme as well and i'm going to talk about that now it's going to involve some spoilers so if you've never seen the film that's your warning i do recommend it i think that it is way better than people say i think in the future it will be regarded more highly than it is now when jennifer and needy meet this indie rock band they think that jennifer's a virgin and jennifer's not in fact needy overhears this tells jennifer they think you're a virgin she's like what that's kind of funny when they take her in their van later she begins to realize she's made a big mistake and she thinks that her defense is saying i'm a virgin are you even sure she's a [ __ ] virgin man yes yes i'm a virgin i'm a virgin i've never i've never even done sex i don't know how so you guys should find somebody who does know how but in reality that's exactly what they want to hear because they want to sacrifice a virgin they're agents of satan and if they can just sacrifice one their indie rock band will be successful because it's really hard out there for indie rock bands nowadays which is also [ __ ] hilarious the point being is that if she had just been honest and said that she's been [ __ ] since junior high she would have been saved the film isn't saying that having sex before marriage is bad it's actually kind of endorsing it so naturally you know some people will probably not like that and some people don't like that but that's fine it's a movie and it definitely wasn't lost on me that a bunch of dudes are offering up a woman on a sacrificial altar to achieve professional success the point is this movie was ahead of its time and the films that we get nowadays like 2019's black christmas are so aggressive and so angry with their message that they alienate a large portion of the audience jennifer's body didn't this is a movie that anybody can watch you know just from my perspective there's a great male character in this movie chip played by johnny simmons is actually a genuinely good guy and him and needy have a loving healthy romantic relationship with one another in fact at the end of the film when chip becomes the classic damsel in distress and needy has to run to rescue him i'm actually really sad when he dies because he's such a nice wholesome character that you don't see that much in movies like this and since we're talking about spoilers if you don't know jennifer is a succubus since she wasn't a virgin and this indie rock band sacrificed her she came back to life so she needs flesh to sustain her life and so every once in a while if she hasn't eaten she starts to look really drained and very pale and there's this really sad scene where she's putting makeup all over her face to try to hide that and the sadness is heightened by the fact that her desk is filled with photographs of herself it's like that's all she cares about is her image how she looks also jk simmons has the most hilarious [ __ ] wig in this movie look at that [ __ ] hair piece i i love it i look it look at him something else i like about the film is that it opens with needy in an institution and you can tell that something happened to her she kicks the [ __ ] out of this orderly and you think it's done for shock value or comedy because the orderly flies back pretty [ __ ] far then she punches a tetherball and it just breaks and again seems kind of like it's for comedy but at the end of the film you realize that after she fought with jennifer and killed her she gained some of jennifer's powers so that kick and punching the tetherball and breaking it is not just for comedy it's because she's super strong now and i love when films can have something presented in one way and then just have it mean something completely different when you watch it again listening to the director and writer talk about this film on the commentary you can tell they're frustrated there's many portions throughout where they say that shot that should have been the poster or i wish that was in the trailer i wish that was on a billboard and you can tell that they were frustrated by the way 20th century fox promoted this movie to people to put it in perspective on the audio commentary karin kusama said that this was one of the first shots they filmed because she knew that if they showed the studio megan fox walking down a hallway in slow motion that would satiate them and they'd leave her alone that's pretty [ __ ] sad if you ask me it was promoted mostly to boys 12 to 14 year olds who can't even see the movie unless they're parents with them and that was a giant mistake and i think it's taken 11 years honestly for people to actually start to appreciate jennifer's body for what it is even the first time i saw it i thought it was all right it's just it really just stayed with me and i wanted to watch it every once in a while like once a year and i just kept watching it to the point where i realized that this movie has a lot more to offer than most films of its type i'm going to give jennifer's body an a minus well the test screenings were were horrible and i believe that's because of the audiences that were recruited for the screenings which were like frat boys exactly the studio had a very strong unshakable belief that this movie needed to be marketed to young men specifically so that was who came because of me i'm assuming yes okay yeah exactly um i got a very memorable email from from a marketing person at the studio once right i you know had sent him this articulate defense of the film and here's how it should be marketed and i said what specifically are you thinking and he wrote back megan fox hot three words four so they're a trailer together that was for marketing in terms of general in terms of what is the value of this film okay so that should give you an idea of where okay where they were going with it if you hated this movie the first time you saw it maybe check it out again just distance yourself from the marketing take it out of context from its time and forget about the imagery that the marketing tried to sell this movie as and just watch the movie as a dark comedy with horror elements guys thank you so much for continuing to watch the

"""https://youtu.be/143atHg3yME""",Blade,you're one of them aren't you no i'm something else blade welcome back to the eighth annual halloween special tonight we're going to be talking about a film that you might not normally associate with this time of year but i certainly do before neo morpheus and trinity punched a bunch of people while wearing trench coats and sunglasses before wolverine fought sabertooth on top of the statue of liberty and before spider-man swung around new york city wesley snipes killed a [ __ ] ton of [ __ ] vampires in 1998 and it was awesome blade is a film that's gotten more respected over the years obviously when it first came out people enjoyed the movie it was successful at the box office and it spawned two sequels one of which is actually good blade trinity being a giant [ __ ] garbage fire but the film received pretty polarized reviews from critics to top it off coming out in 1998 this film was released after the worst year for superhero films ever men in black of course being the exception but that certainly isn't a superhero film and so blade had everything to prove the following year and this film got made because wesley snipes wanted to do it so many view this film as the movie that launched the takeover of superhero movies but it feels completely different than what we have today today is a very episodic narrative that never seems to end blade is a film that is definitely not concerned with any of that in fact while making the film they didn't even know if they were going to be able to make a sequel or not and over the years a lot of people seem to have completely forgotten that blade exists black panther is often credited as marvel's first black lead when blade did it 20 years prior blade tells the tale of the marvel comics superhero who is known as a day walker he has all the strengths of a vampire but none of the weaknesses he can go out in the day sun doesn't affect him but he does have a thirst for blood he's friends with whistler played by chris christopherson he makes all of blade's weaponry so that on a nightly basis he can kill a bunch of vampires i haven't seen this movie in years i knew i liked it it's actually my favorite of the trilogy for some people that's two one is my favorite and i rewatched the film today and it really holds up there are some cheesy aspects to it there's some dated cgi for sure stephen dorff's villain deacon frost he's definitely the weakest aspect of the movie unfortunately he's really hamming it up and it's not that the film is supposed to be taken very seriously or anything it's just that his portrayal of deacon frost felt very whiny he felt kind of like a brat like some rich kid who's lounging around at home dreaming about world domination not a very compelling villain especially when you see him next to wesley snipes and these two people are fighting it just looks like no contest like snipes is gonna [ __ ] break him in half like a twig you just don't really feel that intimidation factor unfortunately but besides that i kind of love blade you often talk about perfect casting for comic book movies you hear about hugh jackman as wolverine or robert downey jr as iron man or christopher reeve as superman and yes all three of those actors it's hard to separate them from that character i think that wesley snipes should be included in that group he is perfect as blade it's hard to imagine someone else portraying him i mean snipes was so dedicated to this role he actually did press interviews in character playing a comic book character is the best of all worlds because anything create a different voice create a different look different sound different way of moving with the talking all the stuff very different from wesley i love mahershala ali and i'm very excited to see what he does as the character but this character could have been portrayed as a punisher type character just a very cold angry vengeful person who never has any fun but that's not the direction they took this character and it works so well in the movie the opening club sequence with the blood sprinklers and blade coming in there and just [ __ ] tearing ass through all these vampires the way they set that up is actually really clever because you follow some vampires who are sort of recruiting someone a regular guy who thinks he's going to get to have sex tonight and he's actually going to be food for a bunch of vampires and you get to experience the entryway into the club through this guy and you think that everything that's happening around him that's the horror all these vampires that are covering themselves in blood and getting really excited to eat him that's the scariest thing in the room until he crawls away and runs into blade and you realize that he's actually the most intimidating thing in this club it's a brilliant opening sequence that works really well and one of the reasons a lot of this movie still holds up is because most of the fight sequences were done in camera wesley snipes doing incredible stunt work his arms and legs are moving like [ __ ] speeding trains it's still really impressive and a blast to watch blade's friendship with whistler is one of the film's highlights because there's this sort of macho we don't talk about how much we love each other but we love each other element going on there which is in a lot of movies like this but it's done really well here along the way he meets a woman who he saves who he introduces to the vampire world because she's about to be turned and they have a way of keeping people from turning if they're just about to turn into a vampire they inject them with essence of garlic and maybe that can keep it from happening and that character becomes our guide through this world we learn about his goals what he's after what he gets out of killing vampires and the film is surprisingly more emotional than i remember it being the score in this film is very good and what i like about it is that except for the opening and the finale fights every single fight is not accompanied with drum and bass techno music in fact some of the fight sequences have very serious somber music playing in the background and it creates this ominous tone to the action it's like they knew that they were building up to the big fight sequences that the end has without including that normal techno music that we're used to seeing out of this era of film where every fight sequence has da rude sandstorm playing in the background but they saved that bass drop moment for the very end at one point he rips a dude's throat out and throws it at another guy i mean you've gotta respect that coming out in 1998 a year before the matrix this film also featured a bullet time moment now obviously they were working on the matrix when blade came out it's not like the wachowskis saw blade and then in six months they were shooting the matrix that's just crazy it's just interesting to see how much of a precursor blade was to so many hollywood trends and i also love that the action scenes really don't have that much slow motion wesley snipes just tears through a bunch of people 24 frames per second not slowed down not sped up do that more often hollywood i was really surprised how much i enjoyed blades still all these years later yeah the villain's a bit cheesy and some of the special effects towards the end don't really hold up anymore but not only is this a kind of important movie for comic book films in general it's just a [ __ ] blast i'm going to give blade a b-plus so if you love this or this or this or this or this then you can thank blade for brutally [ __ ] murdering a bunch of vampires before studios ever thought these films would be as successful as they were you ,1
"""https://youtu.be/155-pQtbO8Y""",The Others,sooner or later she'll see them then everything will be different welcome back to the eighth annual halloween special tonight we're talking about one of my favorite haunted house movies ever made and that is alejandro aminobars the others the film stars nicole kidman as a mother in 1945 whose children are photosensitive to light just the tiniest bit of sunlight could be potentially deadly to her children so she keeps the curtains closed all day doors for every room are always shut and locked whenever you enter a new one and she tells all of these rules to two new housekeepers and a gardener as they start work at her house early in the film things get weird when the lead housekeeper tells nicole kidman that she has worked in this house before and knows it like the back of her hand and soon after that she starts hearing noises everywhere seeing strange things her children complain about a young boy that's speaking to them in the middle of the night named victor and from there starts one of the most gorgeous haunted house movies ever made the others is immaculately shot it's such a beautiful looking movie the fog that the house is constantly surrounded in the use of candle light for some scenes instead of traditional lighting and a thrilling sense of movement and pace that never dwindles i've always liked this movie i like it from the first time i saw it in the early 2000s but it took many years for me to love it i'm not exactly sure why but i do have an idea of why and this is going to involve some spoilers if you have not seen the others and you don't know about the film's ending i'm going to talk about that soon and that is your warning i hope you do see it it's great for those of us who have seen it or who don't care about spoilers i'm going to talk about that now the film's ending of course is that everyone in this house nicole kidman her children and the housekeepers they're all dead they're all ghosts and they're actually the ones haunting the living's house the sounds that they've been hearing are the real living people who are there who are also complaining to their family about the ghosts that are in their house and so in a way we have an inverted haunted house story we're watching the ghosts discover that they're dead or at least half of them discover that they're dead throughout the course of the movie before eventually accepting that fate and then we see what the real family that's actually living is going through as nicole kidman and her children haunt their home it's a great ending and i love it now but when i first saw it i didn't because in 1999 the sixth sense happened and i guess spoilers if you haven't seen this movie but i'd be surprised if you somehow didn't know about the twist after that i basically thought that the sixth sense owned the twist of your character was actually dead the whole movie so when the others came out i couldn't help but be reminded of the sixth sense and i didn't love that ending the first time i saw the movie over the years after subsequent re-watches i have come to truly appreciate this movie as well as the ending to the point where that initial concern doesn't even cross my mind anymore it's one of the things i talked about in my review for i know what you did last summer sometimes when you take a movie out of historical context the thing that bothered you before just doesn't anymore it's been so many years since the film came out and you don't really care about those initial thoughts because it's been removed now from popular culture and you can just view the film on its own merits and there is not a scene in the others out of place this is a fantastically constructed jigsaw puzzle of a movie and i absolutely [ __ ] adore it now i often talk a lot of [ __ ] about fall scares in movies you know when somebody puts their hand on a shoulder and you turn around but it's just your best friend or a [ __ ] bird flies out of the shed or whatever you know we've seen it all before the others has one of the best false scares of all time that is how you do a false scare in a movie nicole kidman is legendary in this movie she is so so good this is an oscar-worthy performance that didn't even get nominated she was however nominated for a golden globe also the two children in the film are fantastic they play off of nicole kidman very well especially a la kina man who has to have a lot of scenes with her and you're a child doing scenes with nicole kidman so she has to match her and where these kids could have tanked the entire film if the performances weren't on point they are also i love that alejandro aminobar compose the musical score for the film as well so with writing and directing and musical score this is his vision and his vision is finely tuned at every [ __ ] scene and knowing the twist you can look back on the rest of the movie and kind of test the film as each scene goes on you can say like is this cheating is this cheating no it never does the twist works extremely well it re-contextualizes the entire movie and it doesn't cheat and it makes the second watch an even better experience the others is one of my favorite horror films and i'm gonna give it an a plus performances writing production design cinematography music directing it's all top-notch everything about this movie really works and i think that the only way you can really dock points from it is if you're just not a fan of horror if you are a fan of horror this is the benchmark for this type of film it doesn't get much better than this i would however recommend checking out the innocence the 1961 movie based off of henry james book the turn of the screw that's a good one and obviously the others took some inspiration from that film guys i hope you're enjoying the 8th annual halloween special thank you so much as always for watching and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized you ,2
"""https://youtu.be/WLJMGoAlXr8""",The Craft,this video is sponsored by simply safe four girls are about to discover the dark side you ever heard of invoking the spirit black magic we can make things happen i mean this is it this is real welcome back to the 8th annual halloween special i hope you guys are having a good time with these videos tonight we're going to be talking about the craft the 1996 version because blumhouse has announced that on october 28th the craft legacy will be coming out and so i thought it would be a perfect time to talk about the original version this film's about a newcomer to a catholic prep high school who falls with a trio of outcast teenage girls who practice witchcraft and they all soon conjure up various curses and spells against those who anger them more than most movies of this era the craft feels like the 1990s are bleeding out of the screen the music choices the clothing the high school setting i mean just look at this title card reveal and honestly just about everything about the movie feels like it evokes the era sometimes to its detriment most of the time though i find this movie very nostalgic and a bit of a guilty pleasure i really enjoy the characters in the film every single one of them is very unique and the film does an excellent job at fleshing out each girl our main character sarah bailey played by robin tooney has just moved to this place she doesn't know anybody she has to make new friends and her real mother passed away a long time ago but as nev campbell's character bonnie notices sarah just might have some hidden abilities in an early scene where she balances a pencil on her desk nancy downes played by farouza bulk i'm sorry if i said her name incorrectly has a terrible family life with a stepfather who's probably sexually abusive and a mother who doesn't seem to care that much about her rochelle played by rachel true is dealing with a racist bully at school played by christine taylor believe it or not and bonnie played by nev campbell has burned scars all over her upper body and she has to go through very painful medical procedures as a result so the film does a surprisingly really good job early on making you care about all of these characters and giving them all reasons to want to be very mad and to want to use witchcraft to make their lives better and the movie asks you to get on its wavelength of dark humor very quickly because the girls see that sarah has a suicide attempt scar on her wrist and they bond over that i have some issues with this movie for sure and we'll get into those later in the video but what i like the most about the craft is that very few films of the era had women who were given power that was a rarity especially in horror women and horror were usually running from something escaping from something you know they were very rarely given power and the characters in this movie while they misuse it sometimes because of course you know flawed characters are more interesting than perfect characters who never make mistakes but despite being written by a man and directed by a man the movie actually did a pretty good job of presenting badass women who you really enjoy rooting for up to a point and it's funny because you could watch this film without knowing its rating and you'd probably be positive that it's pg-13 that's because the filmmakers did everything in their power to follow the rules that would give them a pg-13 rating but they still got a rated r because it features teenage characters using witchcraft against people and there are deaths okay the first half of this movie is just a blast for me to watch now this could be a lot of nostalgia talking and that's fine i don't care the fact of the matter is i really enjoy a large chunk of this movie and then part of it just derails and even though aspects of it afterwards are still entertaining and well made it's hard to follow at one point and that's because of a few decisions one of the worst decisions in this film is entirely because of the screenplay there's a boy at school that sarah kind of likes and they go out on a date together even though the other girls warned her about this guy and when she doesn't want to have sex with him he goes to school the next day and tells everybody that they did have sex and she was really bad at it so naturally she's pissed but when the four girls start to discover the depths of their abilities and they all wish for things they want she wishes for this boy to like her and the first time i saw the movie i was like but then when the spell starts working she turns him into her personal servant carrying all of her books carrying her friends books and i was like okay that works for me you're going to humiliate the guy he's going to be your servant that works perfectly for me great but then later in the movie and i guess we're going to get into some spoilers here if you've never seen the craft so that's your warning we're going to talk about some spoilers while he's under this spell he sexually assaults her even though she pushes him off of her it doesn't happen he sure is hell tried and once nancy finds out about this she gets oddly jealous makes herself look like sarah and then tries to have sex with this guy before forcing him out of a window and killing him directly after that sarah is very broken up about all of this and she says i didn't want him to get hurt yeah i liked him i think that he was a good guy underneath it all this entire story line just doesn't work for me i'm very confused by it i can't exactly tell what the motivation is did she want this guy to be her personal servant to humiliate him or did she actually like him and feel sorry for him because he does a lot of things throughout the movie to never earn our respect as audience members or her respect as a character i don't like it it's a bad storyline i hope they fix it in the new one the other thing and this is also spoilers is that eventually the girls turn on sarah nancy gets very power hungry and she uses her new abilities to attack sarah and they have this showdown together where sarah is trying to put a binding spell on nancy to keep her from harming herself or others because she killed this boy at school this whole scene is really fun there's real snakes and spiders and bugs all over the set it's really disgusting they did a great job with it what i don't like about it is that the other girls join in on it and it's very difficult to figure out at what point these girls turned on each other and all of these issues of mine happened during the third act the first and second act of the craft i have a great time watching but all of a sudden things don't really make sense character motivation wise it's hard to pinpoint what sarah did to deserve all of a sudden this turn on her friends and after this sequence the two girls show up and they just apologize and say we don't really know what got into us sorry all right bye and sarah warns them that she still has plenty of abilities and powers and they need to watch out for her so if the craft was one of those red squiggly lines that a business person points to in a cliche movie scene it would go up level out and then crash the ending of the film just doesn't work for me but this film does have a cult following and i do like the majority of this movie and i am recommending it overall even though the last 20 minutes just don't work for me there is a following for this movie and there's sort of a fan theory that's developed based off of an earlier shooting script that didn't get into the final movie and that's that none of the girls actually have powers only sarah does and they're leeching off of her so at the end when their powers are all gone it's because they're not with sarah anymore and sarah's taking it all for herself i really like that aspect of this movie i like looking at it from that perspective and i think it actually enhances the film considerably despite those issues that i talked about in depth i'm still going to give the craft a b-minus i also want to give a big thank you to the sponsor for

"""https://youtu.be/155-pQtbO8Y""",The Others,sooner or later she'll see them then everything will be different welcome back to the eighth annual halloween special tonight we're talking about one of my favorite haunted house movies ever made and that is alejandro aminobars the others the film stars nicole kidman as a mother in 1945 whose children are photosensitive to light just the tiniest bit of sunlight could be potentially deadly to her children so she keeps the curtains closed all day doors for every room are always shut and locked whenever you enter a new one and she tells all of these rules to two new housekeepers and a gardener as they start work at her house early in the film things get weird when the lead housekeeper tells nicole kidman that she has worked in this house before and knows it like the back of her hand and soon after that she starts hearing noises everywhere seeing strange things her children complain about a young boy that's speaking to them in the middle of the night named victor and from there starts one of the most gorgeous haunted house movies ever made the others is immaculately shot it's such a beautiful looking movie the fog that the house is constantly surrounded in the use of candle light for some scenes instead of traditional lighting and a thrilling sense of movement and pace that never dwindles i've always liked this movie i like it from the first time i saw it in the early 2000s but it took many years for me to love it i'm not exactly sure why but i do have an idea of why and this is going to involve some spoilers if you have not seen the others and you don't know about the film's ending i'm going to talk about that soon and that is your warning i hope you do see it it's great for those of us who have seen it or who don't care about spoilers i'm going to talk about that now the film's ending of course is that everyone in this house nicole kidman her children and the housekeepers they're all dead they're all ghosts and they're actually the ones haunting the living's house the sounds that they've been hearing are the real living people who are there who are also complaining to their family about the ghosts that are in their house and so in a way we have an inverted haunted house story we're watching the ghosts discover that they're dead or at least half of them discover that they're dead throughout the course of the movie before eventually accepting that fate and then we see what the real family that's actually living is going through as nicole kidman and her children haunt their home it's a great ending and i love it now but when i first saw it i didn't because in 1999 the sixth sense happened and i guess spoilers if you haven't seen this movie but i'd be surprised if you somehow didn't know about the twist after that i basically thought that the sixth sense owned the twist of your character was actually dead the whole movie so when the others came out i couldn't help but be reminded of the sixth sense and i didn't love that ending the first time i saw the movie over the years after subsequent re-watches i have come to truly appreciate this movie as well as the ending to the point where that initial concern doesn't even cross my mind anymore it's one of the things i talked about in my review for i know what you did last summer sometimes when you take a movie out of historical context the thing that bothered you before just doesn't anymore it's been so many years since the film came out and you don't really care about those initial thoughts because it's been removed now from popular culture and you can just view the film on its own merits and there is not a scene in the others out of place this is a fantastically constructed jigsaw puzzle of a movie and i absolutely [ __ ] adore it now i often talk a lot of [ __ ] about fall scares in movies you know when somebody puts their hand on a shoulder and you turn around but it's just your best friend or a [ __ ] bird flies out of the shed or whatever you know we've seen it all before the others has one of the best false scares of all time that is how you do a false scare in a movie nicole kidman is legendary in this movie she is so so good this is an oscar-worthy performance that didn't even get nominated she was however nominated for a golden globe also the two children in the film are fantastic they play off of nicole kidman very well especially a la kina man who has to have a lot of scenes with her and you're a child doing scenes with nicole kidman so she has to match her and where these kids could have tanked the entire film if the performances weren't on point they are also i love that alejandro aminobar compose the musical score for the film as well so with writing and directing and musical score this is his vision and his vision is finely tuned at every [ __ ] scene and knowing the twist you can look back on the rest of the movie and kind of test the film as each scene goes on you can say like is this cheating is this cheating no it never does the twist works extremely well it re-contextualizes the entire movie and it doesn't cheat and it makes the second watch an even better experience the others is one of my favorite horror films and i'm gonna give it an a plus performances writing production design cinematography music directing it's all top-notch everything about this movie really works and i think that the only way you can really dock points from it is if you're just not a fan of horror if you are a fan of horror this is the benchmark for this type of film it doesn't get much better than this i would however recommend checking out the innocence the 1961 movie based off of henry james book the turn of the screw that's a good one and obviously the others took some inspiration from that film guys i hope you're enjoying the 8th annual halloween special thank you so much as always for watching and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized you ,2
"""https://youtu.be/143atHg3yME""",Blade,you're one of them aren't you no i'm something else blade welcome back to the eighth annual halloween special tonight we're going to be talking about a film that you might not normally associate with this time of year but i certainly do before neo morpheus and trinity punched a bunch of people while wearing trench coats and sunglasses before wolverine fought sabertooth on top of the statue of liberty and before spider-man swung around new york city wesley snipes killed a [ __ ] ton of [ __ ] vampires in 1998 and it was awesome blade is a film that's gotten more respected over the years obviously when it first came out people enjoyed the movie it was successful at the box office and it spawned two sequels one of which is actually good blade trinity being a giant [ __ ] garbage fire but the film received pretty polarized reviews from critics to top it off coming out in 1998 this film was released after the worst year for superhero films ever men in black of course being the exception but that certainly isn't a superhero film and so blade had everything to prove the following year and this film got made because wesley snipes wanted to do it so many view this film as the movie that launched the takeover of superhero movies but it feels completely different than what we have today today is a very episodic narrative that never seems to end blade is a film that is definitely not concerned with any of that in fact while making the film they didn't even know if they were going to be able to make a sequel or not and over the years a lot of people seem to have completely forgotten that blade exists black panther is often credited as marvel's first black lead when blade did it 20 years prior blade tells the tale of the marvel comics superhero who is known as a day walker he has all the strengths of a vampire but none of the weaknesses he can go out in the day sun doesn't affect him but he does have a thirst for blood he's friends with whistler played by chris christopherson he makes all of blade's weaponry so that on a nightly basis he can kill a bunch of vampires i haven't seen this movie in years i knew i liked it it's actually my favorite of the trilogy for some people that's two one is my favorite and i rewatched the film today and it really holds up there are some cheesy aspects to it there's some dated cgi for sure stephen dorff's villain deacon frost he's definitely the weakest aspect of the movie unfortunately he's really hamming it up and it's not that the film is supposed to be taken very seriously or anything it's just that his portrayal of deacon frost felt very whiny he felt kind of like a brat like some rich kid who's lounging around at home dreaming about world domination not a very compelling villain especially when you see him next to wesley snipes and these two people are fighting it just looks like no contest like snipes is gonna [ __ ] break him in half like a twig you just don't really feel that intimidation factor unfortunately but besides that i kind of love blade you often talk about perfect casting for comic book movies you hear about hugh jackman as wolverine or robert downey jr as iron man or christopher reeve as superman and yes all three of those actors it's hard to separate them from that character i think that wesley snipes should be included in that group he is perfect as blade it's hard to imagine someone else portraying him i mean snipes was so dedicated to this role he actually did press interviews in character playing a comic book character is the best of all worlds because anything create a different voice create a different look different sound different way of moving with the talking all the stuff very different from wesley i love mahershala ali and i'm very excited to see what he does as the character but this character could have been portrayed as a punisher type character just a very cold angry vengeful person who never has any fun but that's not the direction they took this character and it works so well in the movie the opening club sequence with the blood sprinklers and blade coming in there and just [ __ ] tearing ass through all these vampires the way they set that up is actually really clever because you follow some vampires who are sort of recruiting someone a regular guy who thinks he's going to get to have sex tonight and he's actually going to be food for a bunch of vampires and you get to experience the entryway into the club through this guy and you think that everything that's happening around him that's the horror all these vampires that are covering themselves in blood and getting really excited to eat him that's the scariest thing in the room until he crawls away and runs into blade and you realize that he's actually the most intimidating thing in this club it's a brilliant opening sequence that works really well and one of the reasons a lot of this movie still holds up is because most of the fight sequences were done in camera wesley snipes doing incredible stunt work his arms and legs are moving like [ __ ] speeding trains it's still really impressive and a blast to watch blade's friendship with whistler is one of the film's highlights because there's this sort of macho we don't talk about how much we love each other but we love each other element going on there which is in a lot of movies like this but it's done really well here along the way he meets a woman who he saves who he introduces to the vampire world because she's about to be turned and they have a way of keeping people from turning if they're just about to turn into a vampire they inject them with essence of garlic and maybe that can keep it from happening and that character becomes our guide through this world we learn about his goals what he's after what he gets out of killing vampires and the film is surprisingly more emotional than i remember it being the score in this film is very good and what i like about it is that except for the opening and the finale fights every single fight is not accompanied with drum and bass techno music in fact some of the fight sequences have very serious somber music playing in the background and it creates this ominous tone to the action it's like they knew that they were building up to the big fight sequences that the end has without including that normal techno music that we're used to seeing out of this era of film where every fight sequence has da rude sandstorm playing in the background but they saved that bass drop moment for the very end at one point he rips a dude's throat out and throws it at another guy i mean you've gotta respect that coming out in 1998 a year before the matrix this film also featured a bullet time moment now obviously they were working on the matrix when blade came out it's not like the wachowskis saw blade and then in six months they were shooting the matrix that's just crazy it's just interesting to see how much of a precursor blade was to so many hollywood trends and i also love that the action scenes really don't have that much slow motion wesley snipes just tears through a bunch of people 24 frames per second not slowed down not sped up do that more often hollywood i was really surprised how much i enjoyed blades still all these years later yeah the villain's a bit cheesy and some of the special effects towards the end don't really hold up anymore but not only is this a kind of important movie for comic book films in general it's just a [ __ ] blast i'm going to give blade a b-plus so if you love this or this or this or this or this then you can thank blade for brutally [ __ ] murdering a bunch of vampires before studios ever thought these films would be as successful as they were you ,1
"""https://youtu.be/M42dk7Vv1vo""",I Know What You Did Last Summer,for the last year four friends have kept a secret are you on drugs no well then what is wrong i've had a rough year but not all secrets stay buried i know what you did last summer welcome back to the 8th annual halloween special tonight we're talking about a film that for me is the guiltiest of guilty pleasures and that is i know what you did last summer it was very loosely based off of lois duncan's novel which is completely different than the film it's about a group of teenagers who after a wild night of partying hit a man on the road and dump his body into the ocean they make a pact with one another to never speak of the event again until the very next summer they begin to get cryptic notes and are stalked by a man in a fisherman's outfit holding a hook this film is by no means highly regarded in the slasher canon and i'm not going to sit here and try to convince you that it's a great film it isn't for me this is a massive guilty pleasure it's a movie that despite many flaws i enjoy watching and i'm going to talk to you about a phenomenon that i've noticed at least with myself in 1996 wes craven's scream revitalized the slasher genre for the modern day and after that you got a glut of new teen slasher films films like this one or its sequel cherry falls or urban legend in fact this movie has a scene where they discuss urban legends the hook on the car that's supposed to warn you away from pre-marital sex or the guy who's hanging himself with his feet dangling against the top of the car just a year later they made a movie about that and at the time critics were getting very sick of it they called just about every single slasher that came out after scream movies like valentine for instance a ripoff of scream and some of them were obviously inspired by the success of scream and hollywood clearly saw more power given to slashers once again and they probably saw a lot of dollar signs but taking those movies out of their historical context away from the 90s so many years later we can kind of view them now on their own merits and not think about that time anymore and because of that i've noticed that i found myself enjoying a lot of films from that era that were considered at one point bad a lot more than i used to predator 2 being a big example i talked about that in my review of that film and for me it's kind of like technology there's this old saying that the flaws of a current generation's technology will later be perceived as its strengths for instance vinyl when cds were introduced everybody was like holy [ __ ] this is like the best way to listen to music it's so digital and perfect and crystal clear and now a lot of people like going back to vinyl because they prefer that sound or vhs for instance i got a ton of them behind me no i prefer to watch high definition but i like the look of vhs there's a charm to it now there's tons of people that discuss horror films of the 70s 80s and 90s and early 2000s and they use that vhs aesthetic for their intros on youtube or for their marketing in general because the flaws of the era will later be perceived as its strengths and when i rewatched i know what you did last summer the other day all of that came back to me you could just bundle that into one word nostalgia and that is very accurate i am deeply nostalgic about this movie and i'll explain why when it comes to being introduced to horror every generation has movies they saw first as a very young kid i saw psycho on tv my mom showed it to me probably was too young to watch it didn't care loved it but for me some of the earliest slasher films i ever saw were films like scream or i know what you did last summer when they were eventually put onto network television edited for content i was still in elementary school branching over to middle school and people were talking about these movies and they were excited about these movies so every generation has horror films that introduce them to horror and for me i was mostly introduced to the sub genre slasher through movies like this and scream and so it's always going to hold a special place in my heart for that reason is it as good as halloween [ __ ] no this movie has a lot of problems but there's also a lot of things about the film i like and i'd like to talk about some of those first sarah michelle geller is actually pretty good in this movie in fact she outshines jennifer love hewitt i kind of wish that she was the lead for the film i think she has the best sequence in the film as well which is a chase scene from the killer through a clothing department store out towards a july 4th parade with fireworks that entire sequence is actually pretty white-knuckled surprisingly even though i know what's going to happen it's easily the standout sequence in the movie in many ways this film feels like a christopher pike book come to life if you've ever read christopher pike novels back in the day many of them were accentuated by incredible cover art very few films were ever able to capture the feel that i got when i read those christopher pike books or the rl stein fear street books this movie was able to do that i also like that this film is rated r it's billed as a teen slasher but teens can't go to see it without a parent it's not a very hard r that's for sure there's not enough blood the violence in the movie is mostly pg-13 except for two kind of bloody deaths but there's a lot of f words in the movie that would easily be removed today for that pg-13 rating but back then they actually made teen slashers that were rated r that doesn't really happen that much anymore and despite the fact this movie is often billed as a scream ripoff of some kind kevin williamson wrote it who also wrote scream but he wrote this script first and sold it after the success of scream and i like how after they make their pact we get the one year jump and none of their dreams are working out the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film before the accident they're all talking about their hopes their dreams their desires what they want to do with their lives and none of them are really doing that one of them works in a clothing department store the other looks like they haven't left their house for a year and their mother thinks they're on drugs the other guy's being a fisherman just like his dad even though he didn't really want to do that there are some teen horror films of the era that never allowed its characters to face consequences everything felt very frivolous in this film after that year jump you can tell that everyone is riddled with guilt they've all been changed by this event and it's weighed on their lives and their consciences and once all of them start getting attacked by this guy and they get these cryptic notes the film admittedly slows down a little bit as they have to start investigating it's important to learn about the plot and it's also important to build some sympathy for them because if they didn't feel guilt if they didn't experience consequences then they would just be these [ __ ] kids who dumped a body in the river and we couldn't really connect with them as characters but because their lives suck so much now it's easier to to feel some kind of connection with them and while they're all being terrorized by this guy i like that these two characters sort of stare at each other in this moment and have this fleeting remembrance of happiness what their lives used to be like before all of this there are these tiny little pieces and i know what you did last summer that actually feel like a really good movie is trying to come out of a somewhat average teen slasher all of that stuff about this film really works for me but there's a lot that honestly doesn't jennifer love hewitt's character julie james is pretty useless she uncovers some information she does some investigating she's not completely unlikable as a character but once the big finale fight starts she does nothing but scream like if she hadn't screamed at that last moment freddy prince jr might not have gotten knocked off the boat but like what what is why did that happen the character of helen played by sarah michelle gellard is just a better character in general i i think that maybe she should have been the lead of this film in fact i like the idea that it starts out with her as this beauty queen and later she's just completely depressed working in a clothing department store and doesn't really know what's become of her life i think that's a lot more intriguing than the sad sack whose mom thinks she's on drugs who is i guess the lead of the movie for some reason also and this is spoilery if you've never seen the film there's an epilogue at the end after you think everything's done the guy just shows up a year later and bursts out of a shower this ending makes very little sense when you consider that a sequel came out a year later which is probably exactly what the filmmakers of i still know what you did last summer thought because they immediately retconned this ending as a dream sequence at the beginning of the sequel i had another dream one in the cellar no there's also a scene in the film that i find absolutely hilarious and it's best if i just show it to you [ __ ] that old guy has no idea what's going on i feel bad for him that poor old guy without a doubt i know what you did last summer is a cheesy at times melodramatic slasher film that certainly is not one of the best but i have always had a soft spot for it because of all the things i talked about earlier in this review and because taken out of context from the 90s and just viewed today it's directed better than a lot of the slasher films i've seen in recent years i'm going to give the film a b minus it's hard for me to grade this movie because i'm always going to enjoy watching it yes i see all the things that i talked about but sometimes you just don't care sometimes a movie just works for you and this is one of those films for me guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon in the 8th annual halloween special and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck monized you ,1
"""https://youtu.be/GFJsnh1MlEE""",The Exorcism of Emily Rose,it just begun for the glory of god welcome back to the eighth annual halloween special tonight we're going to be talking about a film that i don't think gets as much credit as it deserves and that film is the exorcism of emily rose directed by scott derrickson who made hellraiser inferno the day the earth stood still doctor strange sinister deliver us from evil and this film and this film takes a very unique approach to the stereotypical exorcism film that we're so used to seeing there's tons of movies that are called the haunting of and that a person's name or the exorcism of and then a person's name or a place or a location the haunting of molly hartley the haunting in connecticut there's a lot of these movies and when you hear just the title of this film it immediately sounds like it's going to be some direct dvd or vod movie that is really bad but this film is very different from the rest it stands out significantly because the film mixes an exorcism horror film with a courtroom drama and it does so to great effect critics did not love this film when it was initially released but it has since developed a bit of a following largely because people saw sinister went holy [ __ ] that was really good went back and watched scott derrickson's filmography and came across the exorcism of emily rose and were surprised by the quality this film has an incredible cast laura linney tom wilkinson jennifer carpenter campbell scott henry zerny and colin fiore who i'm always going to love from storm of the century side note if you've never seen storm of the century it's [ __ ] awesome and you should watch it it's a really good stephen king miniseries the exorcism of emily rose is about a lawyer who takes on a negligent homicide case involving a priest who performed an exorcism on a young girl from the very beginning of this film it subverts your expectations you have this lonely house in the middle of nowhere it's very creepy you see a barbed wire fence with blood dripping from it the title card comes up and now there's this man with a hat and a trench coat walking up to this house and you assume that must be the exorcist going to visit this girl to exercise a demon but then you find out he's the medical examiner and you realize the girl's already dead the exorcism failed it didn't work and the priest is there tom wilkinson mourning this loss terrified at what that could mean for himself and for this family and mourning the loss of a girl that he cared about and i saw this film not knowing what it was about i had absolutely no idea and i watched it purely because i'm a fan of scott derrickson and so i was very interested immediately i was hooked within a few minutes because from the opening scene you don't know where the film's going you meet laura linney's character who takes this case because eventually this priest played by wilkinson is prosecuted for a negligent homicide they're trying to send him to jail because they believe that this girl was epileptic and that she needed care she needed medication not an exorcism and if they had just been able to give her the drugs that they thought she needed she would still be alive so the film becomes a question of faith the defense is entirely built around the fact that you have to accept that both the girl and the priest believed she was possessed and believed they were doing the right thing and that he had consent from her and their family whereas the prosecution is saying none of that [ __ ] matters the girl's dead she should have been given care not that type of care so the film is filled with fascinating questions of faith whether you believe in god satan demons possession exorcism all of that is literally on trial and it's boosted by magnificent performances particularly from jennifer carpenter and tom wilkinson laura linney's excellent in the movie and so is campbell scott as a ruthless lawyer but jennifer carpenter really shines as emily rose because as the court proceedings play out you get to see the backstory you watch how all of this came to be for emily rose she contorts her body into horrific poses she's screaming spits flying from her mouth she's terrifying in this movie and derekson does an excellent job at making sure that the exorcism scene that eventually occurs doesn't feel like other exorcism scenes there's a uniqueness to it he uses handheld a lot but not to an ugly extent his film never looks bad in fact one of the things i love about this movie is his use of lighting particularly darkness and shadows there's a lot of horror films that tend to over light the night time to the point where characters are in a place where there really isn't any light but somehow you can see everything there's many sequences in this movie where laura linney is creeping through her apartment at 3am the witching hour because as the priest tells her if she takes this case the demonic entities that surround it are going to become interested in her so every night in her apartment things start to move around she hears noises she smells something burning so she's wandering around her apartment and sometimes you can't even see the features of her face the darkness and shadows in the film is very realistic and i've always appreciated whenever a filmmaker is able to do that with their film and not rely on tons and tons of lights just to create this very visually beautiful moment that feels impossible i also like how the court case does not feel one-sided every time the prosecution makes a point it's a good point very rarely do they ever say something that just feels like the evil bad guys are making a case and you feel bad for the underdogs there are plenty of moments where the prosecution will make a great point and you have to acknowledge that that is a great point it kind of puts you in the seat of the jury makes you question whether or not this girl or the family are insane maybe she really did have medical problems and there's one specific aspect of the movie just that opening visual where you see a barbed wire fence and blood dripping from it later in the film and i guess this could be a little spoilery if you've never seen the movie so i just want to warn you that i will be talking a little bit about spoilers for the rest of this video later in the film she claims at one point that she had stigmata the wounds in her palms and feet but the lawyer for the prosecution says she could have just grabbed that barbed wire fence and cut her palms and you remember that opening shot with the blood dripping down the fence and it puts doubt in your mind but at the same time she could have had the stigmata already then grab the fence and got blood on it so it's 50 50. i love that about this movie it doesn't outright tell you this person's right this person's wrong it allows you to get into their heads and make up your own mind yeah you tend to be on the side of the priest because you're watching a film called the exorcism of emily rose but the eventual verdict in the case doesn't get melodramatic or cheesy and like i said spoilers i'm going to discuss the verdict so if you haven't seen the movie again second warning even though laura linney's character was able to make this grand case for the fact that they all believed she was possessed and that the exorcism was consented and approved by all of them and it's what they wanted the jury still finds him guilty but they recommend that time serve to be his sentence because he has spent the entirety of this courtroom case in jail already so it's a win but it's not a win and just like the ongoing battle of trying to prove or disprove things that people believe in like faith god heaven hell satan it's 50 50. you never can you can't disprove it and you can't prove it and so the way the film ends is actually kind of perfect for it because he has consequences and that technically he is guilty of a crime and he can't go back to his church and serve there anymore but at least he's not rotting in jail so the movie doesn't have like oh everything's perfect let's all clap and cheer ending that's something i've always really appreciated about it i also really love the fact that this is a pg-13 horror film that does not rely on gore it is entirely built up around suspense and it is filled with adult characters and adult themes it's a very mature themed movie even though it's pg-13 it's one of the very few pg-13 horrors that actually does scare me because it feels realistic it feels adult it feels like there's real weight and dramatic implications to the things that are happening in the film i think this is one of the better mainstream horror films of the 2000's era i'm gonna give the exorcism of emily rose an a minus i've seen scott derrickson and his writing collaborators see robert cargill talk about making more horror films in the future and i really hope they do soon guys thank you so much as always for continuing to watch the 8th annual halloween special and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized ,2
"""https://youtu.be/homREW9mu58""",I Saw the Devil,wow i hope you guys are having a good time with the 8th annual halloween special i'm having a blast today we're going to be talking about one of my favorite korean films ever made i saw the devil this is a horror action hybrid directed by ji woon kim he made another more traditional horror film called a tale of two sisters that i would highly recommend checking out as well early in the film we see a young woman abducted by a crazed psychopath and this man does horrific things to her some of them we see some of them are suggested and implied when her body parts are found amongst the sewage yeah this is a [ __ ] up movie her boyfriend seeks ultimate revenge but this isn't just a normal revenge story this isn't just about finding someone and killing them the unique twist of this film is that every single time this guy captures the killer he'll inflict some damage on him and set him free he'll break an arm he'll bash his skull in but he won't kill him he lets him go because he wants this man to suffer but the film reaches heights that other movies don't because this guy is the perfect opposition for our hero because while he's being tortured psychologically and physically he starts to kind of enjoy it and figure out just exactly how he can [ __ ] with our hero by making the hero think that all of these things don't have an impact on him and so these two going head to head is one of the best cat and mouse movies i've ever seen because it's not just people trapped in a house or in one location it's all over the place these people are constantly being released and caught and released and caught again and beaten up and tortured and then released and then beaten up and tortured again and it does not get old because each sequence shows us these things in a new and interesting way i was watching the film and i was like should i put this in the halloween special and i was like [ __ ] there's decapitations dismemberments there's a cannibal in this movie it is insanely violent and gory absolutely it should be in the halloween special this film is so beautiful somehow despite all of the carnage there's an emotional core to this movie that is so raw and so real the characters really shine through and it never feels cheesy or melodramatic even though it is in danger of becoming one of those stoic hero movies who kills people who harmed his girl and it's never like that and that's because it's anchored by two fantastic performances seeing these men go head-to-head psychologically and physically is enthralling screenwriters are always talking about rules here's where this should happen the inciting incident has to happen on this page the midpoint turn characters should discover these things here you need to have a sequence here or here and a lot of movies like this one out of korea just don't really give a [ __ ] about any of that for instance if i were to ask the director whose perspective am i following throughout this movie he'd probably just say the characters because you're with the villain alone a lot of times and you see his perspective of how he kills people and you're with the hero a lot of times you see his perspective how he's planning on catching and eventually releasing the killer once again a lot of movies pick a pov and they just stick with it this movie has multiple and it always works it's always exciting and i gotta say the action sequences are [ __ ] incredible and these actors do so much of it themselves like this car stunt for instance there he is stepping out of the car after swerving through traffic that's the kind of stuff that you only see like tom cruise doing in america that's [ __ ] badass what i will say about this film is that it's brutal it's not for the faint of heart the violence is really gory and very realistic so if that's not your thing if you're kind of squeamish probably shouldn't watch this one there's even a shot in the film i won't spoil it for you just in case you haven't seen the movie but usually when something that occurs to one of the characters happens to a character in a movie there's a cutaway to an obvious dull fake head cgi head whatever this movie blends it all into one shot you're watching something happen without a cut and it's unnerving and [ __ ] amazing it's also about two and a half hours long and it never drags there's not a boring sequence because every scene feels tense even smaller moments where characters are interacting about something that maybe might not be important feels important the actors are so strong the directing the cinematography and the writing is so strong if you're in the mood for a really gory violent [ __ ] up korean movie this halloween season definitely check out i saw the devil it is worth it i'm going to give the film an a plus god this movie is so good if you've never seen it you gotta check it out but it is like i said a little bit of a warning it's it's a lot guys thank you so much as always for continuing to watch the eighth annual halloween special and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized ,2
"""https://youtu.be/Py82S4k5HTg""",The Mothman Prophecies,past few months people have been coming up to me and reporting strange things weird likes strange phone calls who is this what do you do when someone comes into your office and tells you they saw this in their backyard my wife's drew pictures just like this i'll show you this welcome back to the 8th annual halloween special i hope you guys are enjoying it so far tonight we're going to be talking about a film that had a major impact on me the first time i saw it and that is the mothman prophecies directed by mark pellington he directed this after he made arlington road and it stars richard gere laura linney and will patton it was based off a very famous book of the same name by a writer named john keel he was a paranormal researcher who investigated ufos and all kinds of things this technically non-fiction book was an account of john keele's experiences in point pleasant west virginia in the late 60s where a bunch of people reported seeing something that eventually became known as the mothman the book is filled with horrifying eyewitness accounts of people saying they met someone who called himself indrid cold who gave them prophecies of the future some of them bad and some of them good i actually read this book when i was a teenager and it [ __ ] terrified me i couldn't get through it the first time there was something about it that was extremely scary and it's probably because the book's approach to it was simply a bunch of accounts it's not like a straightforward narrative like a beginning a middle and an end it's just here's experiences that were had during this time and it's very scary the film tells a version of events written in the book but it also expands on some things for dramatic purposes richard gere plays john klein sort of like john keel the author of the book he's a reporter who finds himself trapped in point pleasant west virginia he tries to leave and he ends up right back where he started so he feels like something wants him to be there and this occurs following the tragic death of his wife after a terrible car accident laura linney plays a police officer in this town and they work together to try to solve what exactly is going on because people are reporting seeing something horrifying with red eyes extremely tall stalking the town the first time i saw the mothman prophecies i must have been about 14 or 15 years old my mom and i rented it from hollywood video and we put it in the player and i remember being so scared by the film that i actually couldn't finish it the film has a quality to it that i've never been able to shake very few films are able to accomplish it and that is just being eerie this is an unsettling creepy film that chills me to my bones a horror film can make you jump it can make you scared for the characters but very few have the eerie atmosphere of the mothman prophecies and you can thank mark pellington for that the way he edits this film the shots that he uses the quick flashes of red light at just the right moment [Applause] an off-putting sound design all of this combines to make a very creepy movie and i remember the scene that stopped me when i was a teenager you don't see anything it's one of the best parts of the mothman prophecies you never really see the mothman he only appears in quick flashes and even when he does appear it's not like this grand shot it's sort of like something that seems like only the characters that are supposed to see him might see he's not even really there it was this scene where a woman describes her encounter with the creature it was right here there was only a foot or so between its head and that branch that makes it what about eight feet tall yeah i was getting ready for bed and i just happened to glance out the window at first all i could see were these two red eyes i kept looking at it i couldn't stop i've never had that feeling before like i couldn't move and then i guess it just took off for whatever reason the build-up of suspense over the brilliant first 30 minutes leading to that scene really set me on edge as a teenager and that's always stayed with me the idea of not actually seeing it having someone describe it and then getting almost a pov perspective of it the suggestion the implication of its presence is far more frightening than if they had cut to some cgi thing flying outside of her window all tension would have drained entirely from the movie but keeping it from that pov it chills you for some people the mothman prophecies is a very disappointing movie because it's not a monster movie it's really a movie about grief and about mental trauma and getting over loss and how you can go to such great lengths and great extents for answers that don't exist and sometimes you might stumble across something that you didn't expect to stumble across but that doesn't mean that it's going to make it any better and i think some people just wanted to see a big seven foot monster with red eyes and while you do get flashes of things it's not very satisfying if you're just gonna watch a monster movie mothman prophecies is much more cerebral than that it really wants to get inside your head and [ __ ] with you last night i i woke up with the worst headache i've ever had in my life and i i went into the bathroom to get some aspirin and i happen to look in the mirror and i swear to god i see something i can't describe but it sure as hell and not my reflection if they had cut to some stupid slenderman cgi horrible meme face i would have laughed but you don't see it you just see this really traumatized man who's tortured by this image that he saw in the mirror the previous night and you immediately think of the most horrifying thing just days before they started shooting the production company slashed millions off of mark pellington's budget and he was furious and i can't blame him for being mad of course but whatever he did to hold back i think it worked in the film's favor richard gere is also really good in the film i wish that he was in more horror or thriller scary movies he's very strong here as is laura linney and debra messing although she isn't in the film very long has one of the film's scariest scenes this woman is dying she's just been in this car accident and she has this brain disease that's forming and she's the only person now who has seen this thing but no one will believe her and she's going to die in like days and this thing is just in her head to me that is so much more scarier than some shape that might jump out of the walls or something with some loud music you know what i mean like just that notion of impending death while having this terrifying image in your mind and you know that that's probably going to be the last thing you're thinking about before you go that's [ __ ] up and i haven't even talked about the film's best scene yet which is a conversation over the phone with john klein and indrid cold where's my watch and you're sure under the bed he's able to predict every single thing that klein does over the phone and proves who he is and proves that he really is someone who's clairvoyance or who can give prophecies of the future and he basically curses john klein with this information this weight of a need to save lives unfortunately most all of these great scenes happen in the first half of the movie the last half of the film is nowhere near as well paced as the first things slow down considerably when he has to find the cliche paranormal investigator who gives him all of his answers about this thing then he goes back to him a second time and the film slows down even more and we get a lot of double beats emotionally where we had already gone over this territory at one point and we're going over it again and we're going over it again but the energy picks back up again with a tremendous bridge collapse sequence over the ohio river which actually did happen although this sequence can sometimes feel a bit too big and mainstream for the rest of the movie there's a sort of rogue independent quality to this mainstream movie throughout most of it until this bridge collapse sequence which as i said is handled very well but it can sometimes feel kind of detached from the rest of the movie the mothman prophecies at least for the first like 60 of the film is on track to be one of the best horror thrillers of the 2000s it loses its way a little bit towards the second half but it does pick back up in the end and i do think it is one of the creepiest movies ever made i'm going to give the mothman prophecies a b-plus although everything doesn't quite work in this movie i don't think there's another film like it and i do think it achieves something as very difficult to do and that is have a quality of unsettling chilling creepiness for the whole run time guys thank you so much for continuing to watch the eighth annual halloween special i'm having a really good time doing this and i hope you guys are having a good time watching them as always if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized ,1
"""https://youtu.be/BNdoiwBPJXg""",Predators,predators came out in 2010 and is the last film in the predator franchise i've never reviewed i'm sorry it took me longer than i thought to give this review to you guys after publishing predator 2 tennant the new mutants bill and ted 3 mulan all these movies hit and then tiff started and i've been so busy so i'm finally able to sit down and talk about this movie this film opens with adrian brody falling from the sky and landing in the jungle where he encounters a bunch of other folks who've been thrown into this jungle against their will and they slowly realize that they are being hunted i was so on board when this movie came out i was so ready to see a new predator film i liked the idea of it being in the jungle but i expected it to be a little more different and predator 2 being the film that was last in the franchise officially because this series doesn't really count the avp movies that film came out 20 years before this movie at the very least that movie did try to do something completely different with this story this movie threw a bunch of folks in a jungle again and had a bunch of predators picking them off one by one in many ways predators is one of the biggest fanboy movies ever made don't get me wrong i [ __ ] love john mctiernan's original movie but this movie doesn't really know how to be its own film it is so much in service to that original movie to the point where the new things that it tries stick out like a sore thumb as if they are trying so closely to adhere to the formula and the structure of that original film that those new ideas don't really work there's one intriguing idea behind this film and that's that the title has a double meaning of course there's the predators themselves in the woods that are hunting these people but all of the people there have very shaky backstories and have really rough lives and they've done things that they're not proud of and so they could also be viewed as the predators the problem is it's not subtle at all there's a scene where the characters state the intent of the theme out loud and unfortunately despite the fact the film has a great cast people like walter goggins mahershala ali lawrence fishburne the film is so derivative of john mctiernan's original film that it becomes very tedious right down to john debney's score basically being alan silvestri's score just reworked slightly and while i usually like adrian brody and i'm also a fan of unorthodox casting choices he just doesn't bring the charisma that arnie brought to that first film it's just not there and he's not as exciting he's not as fun the film doesn't have a likable presence like danny glover either in the lead and so you're stuck with adrian brody grunting through the whole film and covering himself in mud and repeating lines from the original film i'm here kill me something else i noticed about the film when i watched it again was that they don't shoot the predators at low angles enough they tend to shoot them right at height and so they don't look very imposing they don't seem frightening or fierce enough in this movie i'm not concerned about any of these characters or their survival and it's probably because i just don't really care about any of them and that's one of the issues with the theme they're going for are the humans the predators or are the creatures themselves the predators because they constantly show all of these characters doing things that don't really endear you to them at one point adrian brody suggests using a dead body as a booby trap just makes him look like a [ __ ] scumbag and it's hard to care about him as the lead and when the film eventually asks us to get excited about him putting muddle over his body and fighting the predator i just don't really care because i never liked this character in the first place this movie came out in a time period where hollywood was obsessed with figuring out what worked about the 80s and 90s there were so many horror remakes in the mid 2000s into the teens and they just kept happening and happening and happening predators is technically a sequel but it feels like a soft reboot they have long tall sally playing in the ending credits they have so many of the exact same lines reused the score sounding the same billy's sacrifice scene becomes hanzo's sacrifice scene it feels like there wasn't an original idea in this entire film and what i can say best about it is that for the most part it's directed fairly well the first 20-25 minutes of the movie has a mystery because you're wondering what these people are doing there and it's exciting to watch them figure that out but as soon as the guns start blazing you know that the rest of the film is for the most part going to be humans versus predators and it slows down considerably when they meet lawrence fishburne's character who's been trapped there for a long time and is starting to lose his mind there was a period of time and honestly we're still in it with disney's live-action remakes where hollywood just thinks we want copies of things we already like we don't want news stories we don't want fresh stories and sometimes that's our own fault we told them as a majority that predator 2 was disappointing and yeah it's not as good as the first one but i think it's better than predators because it tried something different it legitimately introduced new characters and it had a new story and it successfully fleshed out the mythology of these creatures with the ship at the end and the gun that they throw danny glover and all those skulls that they had collected this film does almost nothing with the mythology of these creatures except to suggest that every once in a while they like to have a party where they kill a bunch of people on a planet somewhere i'm going to give predators a c minus i know some people like this movie but it never worked for me it felt like it was a pale imitation of a much better film that didn't know how to be its own film guys thank you so much as always for watching i've now reviewed every single predator movie i have a playlist for that on my channel if

"""https://youtu.be/W3yuk-2AoQE""",The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,[Applause] the texas chainsaw massacre the 1974 film directed by toby hooper that started a franchise that was at one point in time very controversial that was banned in some countries despite not actually being very violent the texas chainsaw massacre just has a feel to it the gore in the film is surprisingly minimal despite its reputation if you've never seen this film you probably think it's a very violent movie where a bunch of people are cut up with a chainsaw but that really doesn't happen all that much in fact toby hooper actually wanted to go for a pg rating he was really hoping he could get that pg no matter what he did all the cuts he attempted it always got an r and since the violence in the movie is mostly suggested and not usually seen in grotesque up close detail the fact that it got that r rating back in the 70s is entirely because it's really [ __ ] terrifying the film had an opening crawl that attempted to make us think this was based off a true story when it really isn't it was sort of inspired in a way by a serial killer but in no way is this film based on true events it follows a group of young teenagers who are traveling in a van they encounter some curious characters in texas before eventually running into leatherface himself and a big [ __ ] chainsaw the first time i saw this film i actually hated it i didn't get it i just wasn't really ready for it yet i i was expecting something more along the lines of a friday the 13th or halloween a film that is very violent a lot of people die but it's kind of fun the texas chainsaw massacre cannot really be described as fun this movie is very unsettling and it wants to gross you out in almost every scene this is one of the few films that i can't eat while watching i will watch the nastiest most disgusting things in a movie and be eating popcorn or a sandwich or something can't do it with this film it makes you feel like you're in a slaughterhouse and i remember after the first time i saw it i was like all right i guess it's just one of those movies i don't get okay it happens sometimes you watch a film that everyone says is great and it's just not for you then for some reason i just kept wanting to watch the movie again and again and eventually i have really come to respect this movie so much of it has to do with the fact that it is super low budget they did not have a lot of money at their disposal and so they reused a lot of clothing characters wore the same things over and over again they filmed this over a horrific heat wave in texas the actors who partook in the climactic dinner scene were losing their minds everyone wanted to kill each other they were stuck in this house with this rotting food under these hot lights wearing the same clothes day in and day out with this insane heat wave and you can feel every bit of that on the screen this movie truly is very horrifying the characters in the film though i will say are really bad the characters suck the people in the movie are just objects the only reason i know any of their names is because for a large portion of the movie they shout each other's names into the woods when their friends go missing this film is nothing but an exercise intention grotesque looming filthy tension and on that account the film works extremely well it's a very frightening movie you constantly feel on edge when characters die in this film it doesn't have that oh they're just actors sensibility to it there's something very disturbing and raw about the film and a lot of it has to do with its lower budget that 16 millimeter look which is beautiful by the way really adds a grime to the movie this grit this sort of dirty texture to everything that makes it really feel like it's happening some people call this documentary style but there's a lot of great dolly shots and movement that you know that they're not in documentaries so i don't really go for that but it definitely looks like he's documenting things that are happening and it's funny because none of the sequels that had more money were ever able to replicate the success of this film because this film's success is so wrapped up in the fact that they didn't have any money and even though i don't really care about any of the film's characters and most of them are just bodies that are going to be disposed of in horrifying ways the film still works because of all the things i just mentioned that movie has a sensibility to it that a lot of horror movies don't have and it is an added sense of realism and the close-ups of her eyes during the dinner scene are [ __ ] terrifying of course all this builds to one of the most iconic endings in horror history it's a sequence that is so simple but the lack of music and the almost 15 straight minutes of screaming and the fact that it just cuts to black with no musical accompaniment texas chainsaw massacre achieved something horror that very few films did and i'm going to give it an a minus if this film had more money and it was a bigger studio film i would probably be harder on it but i understand that what they were going for was just an exercise intention and they really [ __ ] pulled it off characters though are terrible like there's nobody in this film except for leatherface that is going to be iconic in regards to horror but besides that the movie really [ __ ] works and if you've ever seen the film maybe you were too young or something you didn't appreciate it maybe try watching it again now and just view it from that lens because damn it's [ __ ] good and i'm almost ashamed that i didn't like it the first time i saw it i think maybe part of it was because i started watching the movie while eating a sandwich and i remember holding my sandwich as soon as the first hitchhiker shows up i was holding my sandwich like this was a [ __ ] mistake guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews coming to you very soon in the 8th annual halloween special as always if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized ,2
"""https://youtu.be/lreGPNl9nXA""",Wolf,the wolf bit me i don't think so well you weren't there well not all who are britain change there must be something wild within wolf was directed by mike nichols and stars jack nicholson michelle pfeiffer christopher plummer james spader really excellent cast and this film tells the tale of a book publisher who hits a wolf with his car in the middle of the night approaches what he believes to be a corpse and that wolf bites him and slowly he begins to turn into a wolf which makes his business life really difficult wolf is a film that no one really talks about ever aspects of it are dated for sure mike nicholls clearly had no idea how to film a stunt double without making it extremely obvious there are some very obvious stunt doubles in this movie you can tell that he wasn't really prepared for the high definition era and didn't really think anyone would ever notice but i remember even when i was a child watching this movie on television i remember thinking that looks nothing like jack nicholson but i have found this movie very entertaining and very underrated for a lot of reasons for one it's an extremely mature werewolf movie it's not exactly a werewolf movie in that jack nicholson's character is kind of slowly turning into a wolf but it's basically a werewolf movie but there really isn't that much werewolf stuff in the film a lot of it is just the fact that he's trying to close all of these business deals while james spader's character is trying to steal his job his boss played by christopher plummer is trying to choose which one of them he wants to keep on and he meets michelle pfeiffer who's the daughter of his boss and all of this is happening while at night he really feels like going outside and eating some [ __ ] deer and so the film is actually kind of funny there's a lot of sequences where he's trying to maintain his normal business life while across the office he can hear somebody saying some [ __ ] about him in his ear even though they're super far away because all of his senses become very heightened jack nicholson was apparently very passionate about this movie and tried to get it made for many years he really wanted to play a werewolf and i love that this is a strange casting choice in a way because in 1994 jack nicholson was starting to look a bit old and he was losing his hair he's not exactly the way he was probably when he originally wanted to make this film initially and yet he draws you into this character because he's such a masterful actor and he gives a lot of those kubrick stares into the lens when you know he's thinking about eating something that he probably shouldn't eat and it's [ __ ] fun it's just a really entertaining movie that is a lot better than i think most people say and that's if you can go along with the fact that so much of this movie is about a job that he really wants to keep and james spader who is his buddy but also is going behind his back trying to steal this job from him gets bit at one point as well and so now we have a real serious supernatural confrontation going on and the blossoming romance between michelle pfeiffer's character and nicholson's is surprisingly not melodramatic at all it doesn't feel cheesy i thought i thought that rewatching the movie that it would i haven't seen the film since i was a kid and watching the film again the other night i was struck by how we don't really see movies specifically this kind of film at all really not just a werewolf movie but a sort of mid-budget range movie that's about a businessman turning into a werewolf in the 90s into the early 2000s a film like this didn't feel very special it felt like a run-of-the-mill werewolf movie there were a lot of them back then but nowadays films like this simply don't get made a werewolf film today would have to be a lot cheaper we're talking like one to five million the upcoming wolfman film that lee wannel is making will probably exceed that but that's because he made the invisible man and it was [ __ ] good usually a movie like this would never get made today and so today it kind of stands out you just don't see a 70 million dollar werewolf movie anymore with big stars who aren't really werewolves that much during the film and so some people were very disappointed by this movie it's a type of movie that asks a lot of the viewer and the marketing didn't really help the marketing just makes it look like an action-packed werewolf film and it's definitely not power without guilt love without doubt it feels good to be a wolf don't look so scared if you haven't seen wolf i want to talk about a few spoilers really quickly i like when james spader just has a bandage on his hand in one scene and you're like oh that's right nicholson did bite him and that's just sort of in the back of your mind it's not shown in a close-up it's it's just there in the scene if you look at it sort of reminds you that's right he was bit so later on in the movie when he is talking to michelle pfeiffer and his eyes are different they're very creepy looking you know he's getting closer and closer to changing and i like that the film does not have the transformation scene as we are used to it these two men very slowly gradually are turning into wolves and you can see that progression throughout the film so when they're eventually going head to head at the end although there's too much slow motion and a lot of jumping there's some really fierce shots where they're just tearing the [ __ ] out of each other and even though it's an obvious animatronic or a prosthetic head it looks kind of cool i don't know what it is there's a lot of times in horror films where i absolutely know i'm looking at a fake head or a fake arm or a fake body and i sort of love that like there's a lot of shots and john carpenter's the thing where i know like that's obviously a prosthetic head or that's obviously a prosthetic body but i would prefer that considerably over some like digitally composited shot of cgi bodies and heads i i always am going to love the practical and wolf has a lot of that it also has an extremely painful looking stunt wolf has its issues it's not exactly the werewolf film that a lot of people wanted it to be but if you go into the film knowing what it is which is a businessman desperate to keep his job while he slowly turns into a wolf i think he'll have a good time i'm gonna give wolf a b guys thank you so much for continuing to watch the eighth annual halloween special and as always

over the course of one of the most fun haunted house movies ever made now there's a lot of debate that's gone on over the years about who actually directed this movie toby hooper's films like texas chainsaw massacre look nothing like poltergeist they don't feel like poltergeist and it feels very much like an amblin production a steven spielberg movie it feels like his hands are all over this thing it doesn't feel like anything else hooper ever did this could be because spielberg co-wrote the film and so a lot of his tendencies are in the movie but some people on set have said that spielberg was actually behind the camera more often than he admitted although he has maintained over the years that toby hooper made this movie and it's his film whatever the case poltergeist is a lot of fun this film has a very spielbergian touch to horror in that even when it is supposed to be scary he tries to put light-hearted touches to the movie he uses a lot of humor in between scares and sometimes that can be to the film's detriment i don't find this movie all that scary all these years later i think for me it's just more of an enjoyable watch there's certain horror films that i really love to watch every halloween like trick or treat and this film follows more in that category for me i don't find poltergeist scary in the least i just find it exciting and entertaining sometimes that can be a disservice to the movie because you can tell that spielberg was really hoping for that pg rating at the time it was just pg or r so even though there are some very gory elements in this movie like the guy imagining himself ripping his skin apart toby hooper and spielberg showed a lot of restraint in this movie and sometimes that made it less scary and sometimes that actually made it better because even though this film has a lot of special effects and some of them haven't aged well the film also uses a lot of practical effects when it goes for its scares you can tell in spielberg's writing in his producing that he wasn't quite ready to get to that temple of doom level of darkness that he got to a few years later the family dynamic in poltergeist is excellent craig t nelson and jo beth williams feel like an old married couple with tons of stories they feel very lived in every time they're on screen talking about their past especially in this one bedroom scene you really feel like they've been together for a while but they're not sick of each other they love each other even more and the children in the film are great especially young heather o'rourke who tragically passed away some years later she's really good in the film when she needs to be creepy she is when she needs to be an adorable lovable little girl she is really great child performances all around where the film sometimes falters for me is its second act because it's a lot of spectral investigating various mediums come over people who are interested in photographing ghosts come over and it feels like the entire second act is that and while you do take some pauses to learn more about the family and some backstory that's important and some of the scares are really exciting some of the special effects don't really hold up anymore and so the scares and the wonder that comes from them just really isn't there my favorite aspects of poltergeist are by far its first and third act because spoilers if you've never seen poltergeist you should check it out it's it's a good movie it's worth your time but if you've never seen the film i'm gonna talk a little bit about the ending once they get their daughter back after she was sucked into the television i love everything that transpires after that the stretching hallway is wonderful jerry goldsmith's score is really good he made some of the best horror scores period between this and the omen the guy was a genius and i love all of the dead bodies coming out of the ground forcing the land developers to realize what they've done that they moved the gravestones but not the actual bodies and so all of these ghosts and spirits are just haunting the area because they're pissed and they should be it's really fun stuff poltergeist is that rare horror movie that is just more entertaining than it is scary i know that some people find this film terrifying i'm not one of those people i just really enjoy watching it and it's definitely a halloween staple i'm gonna give poltergeist a b plus guys i am so excited to talk about more horror films with you all through the month of october this is going to be a lot of fun guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized you ,1
"""https://youtu.be/O1Ler6_skK4""","TIFF 2020: Pieces of a Woman, One Night in Miami, Nomadland",the toronto international film festival is happening right now and for the first year ever i actually got pressed to tiff and it's a very strange feeling i'm used to being excluded from that so it's it's fun to to be a part of it this year but this year is very different press screenings are being held virtually so i've been able to watch a lot of these films from home it's extremely convenient and although i love the idea of going to a festival and seeing friends and experiencing these films in a theater at least we get to talk about some movies this year and there's going to be a lot of films that i'm seeing and there's no way i can make separate videos for all of these i'm also prepping my halloween special for next month right now so we're going to do some condensed reviews of a bunch of movies over the next few weeks starting first with pieces of a woman starring vanessa kirby shia labeouf sarah snook benny safty molly parker and ellen bernstein this film was terrific it has what i think might be shia labeouf's best performance to date vanessa kirby is also incredible in the movie so is ellen bernstein all of the actors are really phenomenal here it's the type of film that will stay on an actor for a very long one take as they deliver their monologue and they won't cut away because the actor is that good and you don't feel bored by that in fact the opening 30 minutes of this movie is i believe a simulated one take i i cannot imagine they actually achieved it in one take i do not know that for a fact but there are some specific elements of the first 30 minutes that cannot have possibly been done in one take it's mesmerizing and incredibly stressful pieces of a woman is a film riddled with anxiety and it's very hard to watch sometimes i don't want to spoil exactly what happens but essentially it's about a family that's grieving and you experience why they're grieving in a very detailed way and it's hard to watch but the performances are insane the directing is very strong although the first 30 minutes of the movie sort of threatened to overshadow the rest of the movie because the first 30 minutes are so phenomenal i believe netflix bought the rights to it so hopefully you can see it very soon i'm going to give pieces of a woman an a minus one night in miami is regina king's directorial debut and after seeing this film i want to see her do just about anything her work in this movie is fantastic because this is based off a play and it's largely just people in a room for most of the movie a hotel room and so you don't have a lot to do there visually but the way she blocks these actors she always keeps the sequences interesting the way actors move in and out of the frame keep you on your toes about what level of power they have over the other person in a scene who's winning an argument who's losing an argument the film is a fictional account of one night where muhammad ali malcolm x sam cook and jim brown all gathered together to discuss their roles in the civil rights movement and the cultural upheaval of the 1960s and while the first act of the movie feels kind of breezy and very light as we're introduced to all of these men and what they're doing in their lives at the time obviously muhammad ali at the time known as cassius clay was becoming very famous as a boxer jim brown is an nfl athlete sam cook as a singer and malcolm x for his human rights activism that first act is enjoyable enough because the performances are great and the directing is really strong but the film becomes mesmerizing once these men start to argue all of them are trying to help in different ways and they argue about who's being more successful in helping with the civil rights movement and since all of them have a very different approach to trying to make things better they don't always get along at first that's where this film really shines and it can be very depressing at times because the things that they're talking about in the 1960s could unfortunately be applied to today as well all that being said regina king found a way to make the film feel hopeful in the end i'm gonna give one night in miami an a minus nomad land was directed by chloe zao who last made the writer and is helming the upcoming the eternals for marvel this film stars francis mcdormand as a woman who has said [ __ ] it to the world she has decided to live in a van and she finds herself talking to other people who live in vans no not down by the river chris farley rest in peace oh man now i just got sad you're living in a van down by the river this is a very quiet film that is performance oriented it's very focused on frances mcdormand and her journey she works at amazon for a while she works in restaurants for a while all because she's tired of her old life and she would rather just live off the grid this film is worth seeing specifically for francis mcdormand's performance and the beautiful cinematography but also for the real life nomads that the film includes there's a documentary-esque approach to talking to a few people who actually do really live in vans and including them as characters in this movie and using their real names these scenes with these people feel completely unscripted i do not know if they were but i can only imagine the performances that she got out of these real-life nomads being as good as they were i can't imagine that that was scripted there's some really strong work from these non-actors and it reminded me of under the skin how they would have scarlett johansson pull up to real non-actors in her van and just have scenes with them and they didn't even know they were being filmed it felt that real that being said the film suffers from some major pacing issues i feel because you could watch this movie and you could say that nothing really happens and i would understand if that's what you thought because it is a very observant film it's you you watch francis mcdormand poop in a bucket you watch her get to know people and you watch her live in a van and you understand exactly what that would feel like like if you watch this film the one thing you will definitely take away from it is you will 100 percent know what it's like to live in a van in the middle of nowhere and for some people that could be very boring but francis mcdormand's work and surprisingly the work from the non-actors kept this film very watchable for me i'm going to give nomadland a b so those are three films i just saw at tiff i'm going to be seeing some more over the next few days a few midnight madness films that i hope are worthy of discussion and some other stuff i'm looking forward to seeing guys thank you so much as always for watching and like i said i am prepping my upcoming halloween special that's going to start on october 1st this year so look forward to that guys thank you again as always for watching and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized ,1
"""https://youtu.be/2B8S-Z1wRQI""",Mulan,mulan is disney's latest live action remake that comes to their streaming service this weekend after a long delay due to the pandemic just like the original animation this tells the story of a young woman who takes the place of her father at war he's older and he's injured and he will most likely die if he goes to war so she pretends to be a man suits up and goes off to battle unlike the original animation this film doesn't have the spirits of mulan's ancestors nor does it have a dragon named mushu voiced by eddie murphy or a little cricket this time around there's a soldier named cricket christina aguilera's new rendition of reflection appears during the end credits it's not in the movie there's no songs at all it's pg-13 there's battle sequences this is something that i was actually very excited about i reviewed the original animation earlier this year when this film was going to come out i was very much looking forward to seeing this movie the original animation is one of my favorite disney movies of the 90s but this movie is inferior to that film in virtually every way one of the biggest problems with this film is that it seems to omit certain things that are integral to the story or at least to the characters and their journey through the story and it relies on our knowledge of the 1998 animation to fill in those gaps there's a scene in that animation that is so great and it's still one of my favorite disney scenes it's when mulan decides to go off to war in the middle of the night she takes that sword she cuts her hair she puts on that armor this incredible music by jerry goldsmith is playing it's very epic and you understand just how important this choice is for this character that this choice is going to define their life and it's going to potentially end their life or bring dishonor to their whole family you really feel the weight of that moment in the animation whereas in this film it honestly cuts directly into a scene where she's already got the armor on we don't even get to see her put it on she takes her sword out and points it into the lens and that's the scene then she just rides off into the night you never feel the dramatic impact of this choice that she's making just how much that's going to mean to her life to her family's life the change the evolution of this character you don't feel any of it it's just thrown away and there are so many scenes like that that feel like they have missing information there's one integral moment where she's on the battlefield and she's trying to help all of her soldiers survive and she looks for a place that has higher ground we don't see her go to this place we don't see her choosing this place it just cuts to her behind a rock slinging arrows at people and there's a lot of moments like that where it seems like sequences are missing from the movie and you're sort of running to catch up let's talk about those battle sequences some of them are acceptable but if you've seen films like hero shadow or crouching tiger hidden dragon or the house of flying daggers you've seen it all done better this movie has very high frame rate action that's over edited you can tell they were shooting in high frame rate to later in post choose which shots they wanted to be in slow motion or not but that high frame rate makes the action look very frenetic in a bad way horses are moving really fast people are running very fast and it just doesn't look real it doesn't evoke the time period it looks too fancy it doesn't look like it has the grace that some of those great films i already mentioned have this is a very committee safe movie everything feels very approved the messages that the movie is going for while at times very admirable feel glossed over and insignificant the film boils down to a lot of lessons learned scenes where a lesson is presented a character reacts to it and then suddenly accepts it and realizes that they were wrong it's a lot of people learning their lessons throughout the film and it never really feels like it has that impact it's going for this is definitely an attempt to tell a more realistic version of the mulan tale and many people have attempted to tell this tale before not just disney but this is obviously a film that's going for more realism than the first one removing the musical sequences removing the talking dragon removing the cricket all of that's gone there's battle sequences and there's not a drop of blood and everyone's speaking english so the film really lost me for its attempts at realism and it's like disney is afraid that people just won't like subtitled movies come on parasite just won best picture now i watched this film with my wife and she mentioned something that i didn't really think of while watching the movie but now i can't really get it out of my head and i suppose this could be potentially a mild spoiler so i just want to warn you i think this is a very mild spoiler i don't think it's really that important but just in case that's your warning very mild spoiler from the very beginning of the movie we understand that mulan has a lot of stored up chi she's very powerful and she's told by her family she needs to hide that and marry a man and be respectful we understand from the get-go from the first few scenes that as a young girl she had a lot of really incredible abilities when she goes off to war she's still trying to hide that power and eventually she unleashes it she strips away her father's armor and rides off into battle in a red gown with no armor of any kind the message of course could be interpreted in a lot of ways one of them could be that you shouldn't hide your inner beauty you shouldn't hide who you are your abilities you shouldn't try to conform to what the world wants you to be and you should let all that shine and be yourself and and not allow someone to tell you that you're inferior just because they think you are that's all great great stuff problem is this film says yes you too can do all of those things if you're the chosen one if you have magical hidden powers that you have been told to not reveal to anyone since you were a child so my wife said the film actually made her feel more alienated than included because instead of a regular girl training her body and her mind to get to the peak of her potential and achieve what no one else could in her time we have a character that's done from the start of the movie and all that's left for her as a character is to choose to no longer hide that which isn't a very emotionally investing arc at all there's no real emotion to it it's just like a hallmark card that says you can do whatever you want and follow your dreams it doesn't actually mean anything you have to like legitimately work hard to achieve these things and and i don't like how disney's doing this trend lately where people just are magical from the get-go and they never have to train or work or learn or anything they're just [ __ ] magical and so the film's message feels very watered down in that regard also the cgi at times can be very distracting the film uses a lot of computer generated lighting techniques i believe and so certain shots look very artificial the battle sequences are over edited and unfortunately the acting can be very wooden certain people are a standout gong li is very good in the film jet li is also really good as the emperor but the lead actress unfortunately is very blank and sort of wooden throughout most of the movie and certain scenes that you want her to really be expressing how important these moments are to her i just didn't really feel that i admired disney for trying to do something different they didn't just make a shot-for-shot version of the original movie but all of the choices they made felt inferior to that original film i'm going to give mulan a c minus guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to mo reviews very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized you ,0
"""https://youtu.be/L83xHjt4goc""",Bill & Ted Face the Music,bill and ted face the music actually exists in a weekend where the new mutants finally came out after a long series of delays the fact that bill and ted 3 is actually a movie is far more shocking to me and far more welcome keanu reeves and alex winter are back as bill and ted once told they'd save the universe during a time traveling adventure they find themselves as middle-aged dads with two daughters still trying to crank out a hit song and fulfill their most bodacious destiny i've never really talked about the bill and ted movies that much on my channel because i didn't really see them that much as a kid i saw them for the first time as a teenager and i like them i like the first one especially bogus journey though i never really enjoyed all that much i've only seen that film one time and i think it was like a big step down after the first one the first one just had this wonderful excitement about it it wasn't trying to be anything that people may have wanted it to be it was just two dudes who discovered time travel with george carlin and it was perfect for that it was just a really fun movie and i've always enjoyed it the second one though i never felt like watching again so i was really looking forward to seeing the exact same writers come back to write a third film as well as the original cast this time directed by dean parisot or pariso i'm not sure i apologize but he made galaxy quest which is a great comedy satire of the star trek universe this all seemed like it was going to be great and i am so relieved that bill and ted 3 is exactly what i wanted it to be i was really afraid that a movie called bill and ted face the music starring older bill and ted released in 2020 would be this stupid pointless dark and gritty version of bill and ted where they realize they're old and they need to get real jobs and stop being like themselves i was terrified of the modern day version of this movie happening and i am so glad it is exactly like that first film in regards to tone bill and ted 3 is such an optimistic movie it's almost sugary it's so sweet and likable and it's not pretentious in the least it's exactly what a bill and ted movie in 2020 should be which is keanu reeves and alex winter once again having amazing chemistry with one another just going all in with their hilarious roles experiencing the versions of them that would be older with daughters their wives love them but they're in couples therapy because bill and ted are so close they have a hard time acting like separate entities for their wives the film captured something that for me the best jokes and dumb and dumber did which is that on the surface it appears as if it is a very stupid movie you know like it's a movie where the jokes are just very easy and silly but they're not they're actually quite smart that's one of the best parts about dumb and dumber and it's one of the best parts about the greatest jokes in the bill and ted movies is that it's showing two characters that aren't exactly the brightest people on the planet but they're endearing and they're very funny and the movie is able to find ways to make that comedy work very well without talking down to them the film doesn't treat bill and ted like they are stupid it just observes them and lets them roam around and do things and i love that aspect of this movie i love that it felt so scatter-brained in most movies i would say it's messy in in this film it's it's what i want samara weaving and bridget lundy payne are most excellent as their daughters they time travel together to find some of history's best and most known and influential musicians to hopefully help craft a song that will save all of reality as time and existence bends and crushes in on itself while bill and ted are time traveling to different versions of themselves in the future to try to ask their future selves how they wrote the song that saved the universe and they spend just the right amount of time in all of their locations they get out before it becomes tedious the different versions of themselves they find i found very entertaining keanu reeves and alex winter both really go for the humor especially in a jail sequence which you've probably seen in the trailers with some [ __ ] hilarious makeup this movie really worked for me and i think a lot of it was because i miss comedies like this i i miss that even today's comedies always have to remind us that the world sucks it's like even when people are trying to make movies to make people laugh nowadays they want to remind you that it's okay to be really cynical and hate life and maybe you'll laugh as well because we're all cynical and we all hate life right i just love that bill and ted 3 is a completely optimistic movie and is just very happy and gleeful and totally okay with being that it's the kind of comedy movie that i i still wish you would see every once in a while that you just don't anymore because we all want everything to be dark and gritty and realistic and sometimes you need a movie like this i also really loved a robot character in this movie named dennis that was sent to kill bill and ted terminator style portrayed by an actor named anthony kerrigan and william sadler back as death which was one of my favorite parts of bogus journey they really did a good job satisfying the fans it wasn't just fan service and nostalgia for nostalgia's sake i mean it's really hard to make a movie that is clearly going to make you feel some nostalgia if you ever watched those films before without being accused of only being fanservice that being said there's some things in the film that i didn't love the subplot involving their wives and couples therapy is pretty much thrown away and their resolution for it is like a line it was just like hey whatever there's also some uses of time travel that felt very convenient it was just like well this happens how did that happen it doesn't matter it happened okay all right okay some of the green screen is also super super obvious i mean you you know it's green screen because they're in some [ __ ] magical fantasy realm but it just didn't always blend as well as it could have and similar to the first movie i i just really enjoy the movie but it can't help but escape a sort of disposable feeling where it was exactly what it needed to be for 90 minutes and then you don't really think about it that much you just remember that you had a good time watching it and that's okay it's it's okay to be that sometimes especially when you're putting a film together that's that's meant to please fans that have wanted to see something for like three decades as far as sequels that have come out far after the fact there's tons of attempts that hollywood has done with this indiana jones 4 die hard 4 i think was 12 years after the last one mad max fury road is obviously one of the best ones but this could have been a disaster and i thought it was so much goddamn fun i'm gonna give bill and ted face the music a bee the film's available for rental right now just about everywhere it's in some theaters and drive-ins please do support the film because they worked really hard to get this movie made and it's actually kind of good and i'm surprised it's kind of good and it came out at like the worst time you know and i feel bad for them it took this long to get this movie made and they actually really tried and put some real effort into it and now it's coming out during a pandemic so if you can support the film please do i think it's worth your time especially if you like the first two but i also want to give a shout out to a podcast that a friend of mine started called barbs wired a siskel and ebert podcast if you guys know me you know that i loved siskel and ebert i watched them all the time on the television i watched d word and roper as well later and i still go back and watch a lot of their episodes they were a big inspiration for me to even start a youtube channel initially and talk about movies online i think people are expecting us to disagree a lot i'm in total disagreement with eugene it's still a great movie coming up next week obviously it's a matter of opinion which is what our relationship is all about that's where we absolutely disagree this movie isn't great but it's good you're easy to please so we're disagreeing about how to agree well i don't like anything on the show except disagreeing with you which i always enjoy gene i'm carrie lynn and i'm skipper martin we're celebrating all things roger and gene on barbs wired a siskel and ever podcast this podcast is great for a lot of reasons specifically because each episode is about a famous or well-known siskel and ebert episode disagreement argument or just one of their favorite siskel and ebert moments and it doesn't just focus on either of them it's it's really just about them as a team they look at siskel and ebert's opinions and some of them they might dissect to see if they still hold up today if there's anything they feel maybe they got wrong or that they just really agree with the hosts are carrie lynn and skipper martin they're going to do a lot of new interviews as well their first is with sneak previews director chuck wagoner they already have multiple episodes uploaded available on many platforms like apple or google so please do check that out i left a link in the description below and if you're at all fans of cisco and ebert or appreciate that era of film criticism and just how much it influenced today's definitely check that out you might learn something and be entertained guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you

"""https://youtu.be/8gXQsAea26I""",Tenet,tenant was written and directed by christopher nolan and it's here to hopefully save theaters around the world as they begin to reopen i saw this at a press screening only five people were permitted in the theater the theater was closed at the time everyone wore masks there was hand sanitizer all over the place it was my first time going to a traditional theater since march when i saw bloodshot i've been to a drive-in this summer but this is the longest span of time that i haven't been in a real theater since i was an infant it was very surreal to go see a movie like this on a big screen armed with only one word tenant and fighting for the survival of the entire world a protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time i just read the official plot synopsis on imdb because it's the easiest way to summarize the plot of the film without spoilers if i were to actually go into the plot of this movie right now it would take the length of a normal review just to discuss that this is a very complex movie despite its attempts to explain itself to us at multiple times the film is a little inaccessible at first for the first hour or so of the movie you're sort of running to catch up to figure out what this world is who our hero is and what exactly his place in this world is it's about halfway through the movie that things become clearer nolan's a big fan of mystery he wants to have the audience ask a lot of questions he likes keeping things from you as you watch the movie for a long time and he respects you in that way hoping that you go on that journey with him and he continues that with tenant tenant is a film that a lot of people will love but perhaps a similar amount of people will not love it's a very inaccessible movie at times especially compared to nolan's other films even films like inception where people came out saying i don't understand that movie i was confused by it i remember being like why it's very simple it's very easy to follow tenant is considerably more complex than inception and it really is going to take multiple viewings to truly appreciate the movie because there's so much that's hidden throughout the course of the movie and so much that that flies by very quickly very important insert shots for instance that happened very quickly early on in the scene that later in the movie really mean something for the characters i respect a filmmaker who takes the amount of studio money that he does to make these audacious movies that make people scratch their heads tenant is not nolan's best film by a long shot but i really liked it i really enjoyed watching this film the spectacle is awe-inspiring visually it's miraculous the things he's able to accomplish in camera with very little visual effects is really impressive people are moving forwards in a scene while others in the scene are moving backwards sometimes people who are moving forwards and moving backwards at the same time fight or are engaged in a highway chase with one another to watch that occur on the screen is fabulous it's incredible to see this movie is visually stunning in every way the highlights being that fight scene that i mentioned although it is not as remarkable as the hallway fight scene in inception as well as a building that seems to reassemble itself while also blowing up as the camera tilts upwards really incredible stuff with tenant nolan continues his interest perhaps even obsession with time and the manipulation of it in the past his films have often featured non-linear storylines here he takes this a step further by featuring objects and even people who are all moving in different directions and spaces of time within one frame the film calls it inversion i won't go any further into it than that we'll keep it non-spoiler you guys saw all of these images in the trailers anyway the acting is also strong john david washington is really good in the film as is robert pattinson elizabeth debicki is also very good in the film all of the acting all around is very good kenneth branagh plays a villainous character and he's really big in the movie like he's really chewing the scenery but he worked for me uh if you want to go there go there and he goes there and i think he's really good in the film nolan's usual composer collaborator han zimmer couldn't do this film because of his work on dune and so ludwig garrinson from ryan coogler's films like black panther and creed replaced him and he's really [ __ ] good i've loved all of this man's scores he he won the oscar for black panther i think he's one of our new best talents when it comes to music honestly you could probably watch this and think han zimmer did it without knowing a lot of the music does sound as if it has a reversed quality to it which matches obviously you know some of the spectacle on the screen speaking of sound though nolan continues this thing he's been doing ever since dark knight rises where dialogue seems to be the bottom of the mix and sound effects and score are above it so there are many scenes where i honestly didn't know what people were saying and i saw this at a cinemark xd so this is a massive theater with really state-of-the-art sound and i'm not sure why he does that it's like ever since tom hardy was bane he was like i i like when people don't quite understand what everyone's saying all the time interstellar had very loud music and you can watch the film multiple times and get more out of it but nolan likes to do a thing in all of his movies where his characters take leisurely strolls through very picturesque environments and they usually give expository dialogue during these scenes it happens a lot in inception happens quite often in tenet and often times that score which as i said is wonderful is often blaring during these sequences which makes dialogue a little difficult to hear also characters are speaking very fast and very quick tenet is technically marvelous and conceptually fascinating but it is however emotionally distant we know so little about each character particularly our lead that nolan seems to be deliberately keeping them at arm's length so while i was always amazed by what he was accomplishing within a frame i didn't really care that much about the people that were filling that frame elizabeth debicki's character is easily the most emotionally resonant of the entire film there's a subplots that i won't spoil for you but basically she's the heart and soul of the movie and she's really all that john david washington's character which is just called the protagonist he doesn't even have a name she's really all that that he's feeling for in the movie and and his real motivation for being in the movie seems wrapped up into helping her and so as a lead the protagonist isn't a particularly interesting character he feels like an object that's used to communicate nolan's story to us and less like a person this is something that happens a lot in his films in a movie like inception a lot of those characters are intriguing but you know you don't really know that much about them the film just works a little bit better though because there is a central reason for cobb being there and you understand why he's there you understand why everyone is working towards a goal in this movie nolan deliberately keeps a lot of that from you until the end and even then once you experience a reveal of sorts it absolutely re-contextualizes the rest of the movie it just doesn't really do it in a way that enhances the people it enhances the plot this is a very plot heavy film it's a a plot over a character movie without a doubt and most of nolan's films are this one though is held up so much by an incredible amount of visual spectacle that is constantly exciting and different and new it's another intriguing and fascinating film from one of our most daring filmmakers working within the mainstream system and it will likely be enhanced by repeat viewings however i'm not going to a theater a second time right now to see a movie i've already seen i'm going to wait to see it again on blu-ray which i'm looking forward to doing i'm going to give tenet a b-plus speaking of new movies uh the new mutants is apparently actually coming out this weekend they finally did it guys they they released that [ __ ] movie so i'll be seeing that hopefully i'm going to like a public oh showing tomorrow i don't know i don't know before before all this [ __ ] this year i was a germaphobe now that has only been enhanced exponentially so um i'll do my best to get a new mutants review out for you guys this weekend for sure i'm seeing bill and ted 3 because that's going to be on vod streaming so i'm looking forward to that guys thank you so much as always for watching and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized you

"""https://youtu.be/kONOIeoNtyc""",The New Mutants,the new mutants was directed by josh boone and was actually released in theaters this weekend which is crazy this film has been pushed back so many times it was originally shot in 2017 the fox disney merger all of that stuff there's probably a lot of videos on this platform talking about it so i'm not going to get into it but the fact of the matter is it's crazy this movie is actually being released there were a lot of people who never thought it would be five young mutants just discovering their abilities while held at a secret facility against their will fight to escape their past sins and save themselves this film has an impressive cast that includes maisie williams anya taylor joy and charlie heaton and having seen the movie i can say that i'm surprised that it was pushed back as long as it was because supposedly the reshoots that were supposed to happen never did happen and this film is basically how it was originally more information about that could come out and i could be completely incorrect so don't take my word for that but there was a lot of problems making this movie and it's okay it's it's not like the next great superhero film and it's certainly not an embarrassment what i like most about this movie is that it feels very different from every other superhero film it's basically just five people locked in a medical facility being told that there's something wrong with them and they're sort of discovering what their powers are and what exactly they can do they've been told that it's their fault that a lot of things have happened and they're supposed to feel really terrible and it's interesting to watch them develop and the cast works really well with each other particularly maisie williams and blue hunt i like watching those characters get to know each other and anja taylor joy is a bit of a villainous presence even though she's not really a bad guy she just says a lot of really offensive things to all the other kids and gets everybody angry so there's a lot of angst being thrown around this medical facility it feels very y a at times and since josh boone directed the fault in our stars this is something he clearly understands so the best part of the movie for me was just the fact that it does feel different it does not feel like another superhero film it doesn't feel like a retread of things that we've experienced before and it's certainly better than dark phoenix but it's also pretty average the movie feels very short if nothing was re-shot it definitely doesn't feel like everything's there that should be there's definitely an attempt to make this more of a horror film there's scary scenes that young kids are going to be bothered by but it doesn't really fully commit to it it still feels kind of like an x-men movie or a superhero film that has horror elements there's a mystery that develops about how these people are seeing these horrifying things in a medical facility what's causing this and i figured it out pretty quickly and once you know what's going on it feels like the movie doesn't have anything else up its sleeve and its reveals regarding its villainous characters also felt really telegraphed i just didn't really feel like there were any surprises in this movie it does feel familiar in that sense from a structure perspective but it's really just the settings the lower budget and the plot that feels different the rest really could have used some more work the accents were really off and on for me as well sometimes they sounded like their character and sometimes they sounded like themselves it was really off and on the new mutants is okay it's honestly a little bit better than i thought it was going to be but it does feel very rushed and a lot of things happen way too quick i was surprised how much i enjoyed this movie mostly because it did feel like something different even though the storytelling felt very familiar i'm gonna give the new mutants a c-plus i don't think this movie is a disaster i just think that it's a movie i'll never watch again but i didn't mind watching it it's just it came and went i don't know it feels like a lot of fuss over a rather mediocre movie and it's kind of weird to me anyway guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to my review of bill and ted 3 you guys are the best and as always if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized you ,0
"""https://youtu.be/dXs9mRcoGHk""",Unhinged,unhinged stars russell crowe and karen pistorius and is about a woman who honks at a man who's stalled at a green light that man ends up being russell crowe a man who's having an extremely bad day and he decides to follow her and make her life a living hell this is road rage times a hundred this movie's been pushed back a lot in america because of the pandemic it was originally going to come out a lot earlier and it's actually coming out in real live theaters this weekend i was fortunate enough to get an online screener for this movie so i don't have to go to the theater and see it i'm not going to tell anyone to go out to the theater right now because people are concerned and i understand those concerns but this movie is better than i thought it was going to be it's by no means a great film and there's a lot of issues towards the last half of the movie logic issues and some very cheesy 90s one-liners that had me laughing but the film was never boring it always kept my interest and much of this is due to russell crowe's performance he is chewing the [ __ ] scenery he's really relishing this role as a man who is on his last legs what i really liked about the approach to the villain in this movie is that usually when you have a movie that takes place all in one day a one-day thriller or a real-time thriller you have a character up against some force but that villain is also trying to make sure they don't get caught they're trying to avoid the police but in the case of this character early in the film he says he has no problem being shot and killed by the cops today so he is going to do anything he wants so there's no rules it sort of frees up the writer to just have a villain murder people in broad daylight and then just walk away because he genuinely does not care if he dies today that makes for a really compelling villain and russell crowe is really good in the movie speaking of the writer carl ellsworth he also wrote disturbia and redeye redeye being another one day one period in time thriller and while that's a much better film it's something he's very good at because those movies are often looked down upon but they're actually very hard to write because you have a character that could at any one point in time get to the police or get to a friend or call the right person and the movie ends and you have to find compelling ways for that to not happen and you have to do it in a way that makes the audience go along with it and you don't want to lose the audience there are times and unhinged where he lost me there are some moments where characters should definitely be doing things differently sometimes people take their seat belts off in the car and start searching around the car and i'm like you [ __ ] idiot you're gonna die one character character's at home and he notices his window is broken and his girlfriend is not answering his calls anymore what does he do no he does not immediately call the police he grabs a knife and investigates there's moments like that that definitely strain logic karen pistorius is also very good in the film although her character wasn't given quite enough at first i like that she's portrayed as someone who has a lot of catching up to do in life she's always late she gets fired very early in the movie and you can tell that she's kind of a disappointment to the people who love her most that's a compelling character but she isn't really given that many opportunities to write those wrongs it's sort of like character baggage meant to make her a person but they don't really come into play throughout the movie that much unhinged is best described as a cross between duel joyride and changing lanes with a little sprinkling of breakdown and i like all of those movies so this film has that going forward it has a really fun performance from russell crowe it has a campy vibe that honestly i was sort of refreshed to see so many films nowadays are so so serious and everything is so important and we're supposed to pay attention to this because there's a message but this movie just wants to have fun for 90 minutes and i admired that i will say my least favorite part of this movie is the opening credits sequence it's completely unnecessary it's two to three minutes of news footage sort of convincing us that road rage exists as if we needed convincing but unhinged was a refreshingly mind-numbing experience and i'm going to give it a b minus guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon i am curious to know if anybody is actually going to go to the theater right now uh tenant and new mutants still scheduled the theaters near me are doing like 30 capacity and i'm still a little leery about that so hopefully i'll be able to give some more reviews to you guys through online screeners like this over the next few weeks mulan obviously is going to be a big thing with disney plus and that 30 thing they're doing tenant i'm positive there's no way nolan would let anyone watch that movie on a computer so we'll see what happens guys thank you so much as always for watching and if you

"""https://youtu.be/0-61t-sxrb0""",Project Power,project power is a new film coming to netflix this weekend starring jamie foxx joseph gordon-levitt and dominique fishbach so when a pill that gives its users unpredictable superpowers for five minutes hits the streets of new orleans a teenage dealer and a local cop must team with an ex-soldier to take down the group responsible for its creation the spec script for this movie originally just called power went through a bidding war and you can understand why a pill that gives you superpowers for five minutes when you swallow it you you don't really know what your superpower is going to be you could burst into flames you could blow up you have no idea you could become impervious to bullets it could be anything which seems like it could be unlimited potential for a really exciting action film set in a world with unlimited possibilities unfortunately despite that great idea this film takes that idea and puts it in the most generic plot ever jamie foxx is searching for the corporation that stole his daughter and he believes that this corporation that stole his daughter is behind the creation of this pill that's causing chaos on the streets of new orleans it feels like a disappointingly bland way to introduce us to this world joseph gordon-levitt plays frank who's friends with this young girl robin because she's a dealer and she's able to give him pills and he understands what his superpower is and he uses them on the job which is a fun story line unfortunately this movie has a lot of story lines that don't really coalesce until its final minutes and and once it finally does it kind of leaves you hanging and wondering why so many different story lines had to be in this movie because the inclusion of dominique fishback's character robin at the end of the film feels kind of unnecessary that's not to say that she's bad in the movie i think she's great in this movie she has a couple of my favorite scenes this is purely a discussion about this character in the script in this story what the character really does for the story and unfortunately it feels very strange to me because you have jamie foxx's character who's desperately searching for his real daughter and he teams up with sort of a substitute daughter who doesn't have a father in her life and for a while he's kind of a father figure while you're watching the film not entirely sure how it's going to end that dynamic feels kind of interesting but i can't spoil the movie for you but once you do see its ending it feels like it led to nothing the directors of this film previously made paranormal activity 3 4 and the film nerve and if you saw nerve this film has a similar style it's very heightened it's very fast things happen very quickly and there's a lot of energy to the way the film moves it's made very competently the shots look really great all the cinematography is very strong the real problem with this movie is its script the story feels like third or fourth draft and it's baffling to me that it went through such a bidding war and it's probably just because the concept is cool the tone is all over the place too there's scenes that feel extremely exciting that feel very sad and depressing about what it's like to to live in a world that just doesn't care about you when your mother's really sick and you're trying to pay for her bills and the only way you can do that is become a drug dealer that's very sad and dominique fishback's character robin adds a lot of emotion to the movie but the film also has a lot of comedy that just fell flat for me and awkward cgi like this one guy who kind of takes the pill and just turns into a giant i don't know the cave troll from fellowship of the ring is the best way i can describe him and it was kind of funny unfortunately i was also surprised by how the film treats its rating which is r sometimes it's very safe there are two occurrences in this movie where someone's about to say the f word and they cut away mid f word like it's a pg-13 movie or something there's also a lot of violence in the movie that is filmed in a way that is very unclear some guy gets his head shoved through an ice sculpture but the shot jerks to the left so quickly that you can't really tell what happened until later they show him bleeding out and you're like oh so that's what happened there's a lot of moments like that throughout this movie where it feels like the film is censoring itself almost like aiming for a pg-13 even though it's definitely not gonna get it but at the same time the movie is also strangely mean-spirited there's a scene where an innocent woman swallows one of these pills and just starts freezing to death and in the background jamie foxx is fighting a bunch of dudes but we don't focus on him we just focus on the woman freezing to death screaming very slowly dying it was very gross actually i'm usually not bothered by that kind of thing it was really nice to see joseph gordon-levitt in a movie again i haven't seen him in a film since snowden i haven't seen the 7500 movie that's on amazon prime jamie foxx is always good i like him in everything he's one of the most likable charismatic actors around dominique fishbach like i said is really good the talent on the screen is phenomenal the directors do a really good job of helming a fun exciting looking movie this is all script problems this all feels like something that should have taken more time i i just feel like they really should have looked at that draft and and tried to figure out what really needs to be there and what doesn't need to be there because it's so strange to have a movie where the entire goal is to find this daughter she's barely in the film but we have sort of like this replacement daughter for the majority of the movie it's just a strange narrative choice that didn't really pay off for me i'm going to give project power a c like i said it's on netflix this weekend so if you guys want to check it out do so it should be pretty easy to see but i don't know i feel like i could have used a lot more drafts guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon including my die hard 4 review this sunday also my buddy scott mance film critic for access hollywood has decided to start a youtube channel he's a

"""https://youtu.be/BaPGdyw0bH8""",Host,post was directed by rob savage this is his first feature film credit and it's currently on shutter this film's about a group of friends who get together on zoom to perform a seance and when they do really creepy [ __ ] starts to happen in all of their separate locations this is a very unique movie for many different reasons for one it's only 57 minutes long so technically it's not exactly feature length and it's certainly not really a short film either so it's sort of like this new hybrid thing and with streaming services and the limitations that they don't have what's to say that we can't get more films around this length it was also shot edited and released during the 2020 quarantine the characters in the movie are referencing the kovid pandemic they're wearing masks if they have to go outside this entire thing came about apparently because the director put out a short that was like this and shutter really liked it and they reached out to him and said do you have a feature film pitch for this and apparently he did so now we have this movie host and it's not like this is the first time that a horror film has been told from the perspective of a computer screen we've had the unfriended movies both of them which are from skype's perspective and there was the excellent film searching which wasn't exactly a horror film but it was told entirely from the perspective of someone's computer screen so this isn't the first time it's been done but i would say that it's one of the more effective attempts at it i think that this movie is actually a lot better than i expected it to be in fact i won't lie when i saw it pop up on shutter as a new movie i was like really 57 minutes a zoom kovid horror movie like because i think a lot of writers and directors are trying to figure out if there's a way that they can make a film during the pandemic or even about the pandemic right now without being in poor taste and this film accomplishes it because it's not taken seriously it's obviously a horror movie with ghosts and jumps and doors slamming and people carrying their laptops around hallways when they probably wouldn't be just because we would rather see the film than just have me from the perspective of their desk and so you're kind of able to detach from reality for a moment and experience a film that was made entirely during this pandemic and have fun and it sort of releases you a little bit from the tension of a covid movie like that would have been taken a lot more seriously than this it's also really well acted all of the actors in the movie are really great they give really convincing performances and from what i understand the movie was scripted but they were allowed to improvise and so there's moments throughout this zoom meeting where it doesn't really feel that scripted they do a terrific job of making it feel off the cuff now the scares in the movie are nothing that we haven't seen before if you've seen a paranormal activity movie or any of the unfriended movies there's nothing here that's going to be new to you people get dragged out of a room and the door slams there's pictures taken of things that reveal something that's not there to the naked eye these are things we've seen many times but i think host is a really good comp that i'm going to use in the future for describing why cliches and tropes of a genre will always work if they're presented in a unique way if they're presented with skill you know there are things that we've seen a thousand times and sometimes you see it in a movie and you just don't care that the door slammed when someone got pulled through it but when you actually feel like that person's real and they skillfully set up this moment it works granted at 57 minutes it's not very long there's a extended set up for about 15 to 20 minutes where you're kind of getting into the characters and sort of understanding how they're going to edit this because that's also a very unique thing this movie has to figure out how to do is how to present you know an edited film based off of a zoom meeting and for the most part it feels very authentic um the cameras go in and out of focus sometimes it seems like a director may have preferred that it was in focus for certain moments but it's not and perhaps that's just because that's how they filmed it which adds to the authenticity of it all and sometimes you might feel that a movie is disposable you don't really feel that much afterwards it's short run time it's familiar scares it is a familiar presentation if you've seen searching unfriended or unfriended too but the characters and the performances and the skillful way that rob savage set up his scares really saved this movie for me in fact i actually really enjoyed watching it i admired all of the things they were able to accomplish with their limited space but if you're bothered by scares you've seen before and you just want to see something new host isn't really going to provide that for you but if you're just looking for a quick and easy scare that might set up your upcoming halloween festivities and yes i know it's august but i'm already thinking about halloween because it's the best time of year then i think host might actually do it for you i'm gonna give host a b obviously if this film was in theaters and i paid full price to watch a 57 minute movie and i knew that it was shot and edited as quick as it was i might be a little more disappointed but since it's coming out and shudder and i know the hardships they were under i know how confined they were as filmmakers and i know how their options were limited i think they did the best job they could have and there's also a few scares that they don't even focus on like if you're looking at one of their screens in a image filled with many screens you might notice something every once in a while which i think is really clever and i love when filmmakers do that when they don't focus on a scare but if you're paying attention and you're looking in the right place you'll notice that i always find that very unsettling and i love when filmmakers can pull that off you guys are the best and as always if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized ,1
"""https://youtu.be/NWsl7SScYK8""",The Rental,the rental is the debut feature from director dave franco it's also written by him and joe swanberg and it stars his wife allison brie dan stevens sheila vand and jeremy allen white and it's about two couples who rent a vacation home at an oceanside getaway and tension soon develops between the couples as their relationships are tested when they believe they see cameras hidden around the home i'm always interested in seeing what happens when someone who's mostly known for a certain profession like acting tackles directing as well because usually they understand a lot about filmmaking they understand how to work with actors what an actor needs how to get great performances out of an actor because they've been on the other side of the camera and in this case dave franco gets a lot of naturalistic performances out of everyone on screen he's benefited by the fact that he has a lot of great actors in front of the camera and i like the setup for this movie as well because as these two couples are going to the vacation home sheila van's character is like hey i tried to book this place this weekend and they turned me down but her friend played by dan stevens was accepted so she's feeling very awkward and uncomfortable right off the bat about having to meet this owner who just might be a giant [ __ ] [ __ ] the film sets up a lot of intriguing scenarios like that right off the bat and you hope that the film is going to continue those things unfortunately for this movie it feels sort of like set dressing you get invested in these characters you learn about what they're concerned about and some of their fears and there's some serious tension going on amongst all of them but it dissipates entirely during the second act when it really becomes just a relationship drama and eventually a slasher movie in its final 10 minutes i found this movie very generic i didn't really see much about the film that was special beyond the talent that's in front of the screen and most of those characters aren't given much of anything to do beyond those first 10-15 minutes any tension that's set up just kind of goes away and becomes a long series of arguments that feel very telegraphed early on just about every development in these characters lives i saw coming a mile away i usually don't like to guess things that are going to happen in movies i actually try hard to not predict things that are going to happen because i enjoy going on a ride with the film and being surprised but nothing surprised me in this movie the only thing that actually took me off guard was just how little happens dave franco's approach to this film is very serious it's very heavy-handed it's not a lot of fun it's actually kind of a somber depressing movie nobody's really having a good time which is very strange for a slasher movie and so i figured alright they must be building to some sort of really serious reveal or they're going to take that subtext set up in the beginning of the movie and they're going to have it come back into play in some way none of that happens i won't spoil it for you but the reveal behind what's happening makes just about everything that's set up in the first hour feel like a giant red herring and the reward for experiencing all that is a bait and switch that seems to suggest the film is super clever when it's just like a hundred thousand other horror movies that have been released it feels like a film made by somebody who appreciates horror but doesn't really understand it there's very little sense of threat or menace throughout the entire film most of it is just a lot of relationship drama and it's nothing special it's just a bunch of friends who aren't really friends who sort of end up at each other's throats he also tends to cut away from the violence and so you never really feel like there's an impact or danger and when there is violence sometimes it's comical there's a very elongated scene with uh extremely obvious dummy body that they try to throw over a seaside and it gets stuck on a rock and they're like damn it someone's gonna find that so they have to pick up rocks throw the rocks over the seaside and they sometimes slam into this dummy's head and i can only imagine that dave franco was going for some comedy because i laughed my ass off and if he was going for comedy in this scene it defused any tension that was there and there wasn't that much to begin with there's a lot of strange comedy choices in this movie for instance all these characters are 30-something but they act like they're in college there's a scene where the owner of the cabin comes to fix their pool and he bends over and you can see his butt crack so one of the girls bends down and pretends like she's licking his ass and i'm like seriously like this isn't even funny this is like what somebody thinks a horror movie should be but isn't it's very pandering this movie could have been a lot better and the talent assembled on the screen suggests that it could have but in the end it's just a very generic slasher movie with really nothing to say that hasn't been said already in movies like 13 cameras and it's strange that this movie acts like it has this grand new idea when it's it's really just a killer who has cameras set up around the house it's definitely been done before and better i'm gonna give the rental a c-minus i figured enough critics would probably find ways to use this film's title as some joke in their review so i just did my best to avoid that but uh if you guys want to see it it's out on vod this weekend but i really do feel like there's better horror out there and i think dave franco has a future behind the camera i just don't know that this was the best genre for him to debut in because it feels like a horror film made by somebody who doesn't understand horror guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to my review of indiana

"""https://youtu.be/cPjOUdeJC7M""",Train to Busan,train to Busan is a South Korean horror film that's been out since 2016 and I am long due for a review of this movie and I'm really excited to talk about it especially since its sequel peninsula comes out in August this films about a zombie outbreak that's occurring and characters that are trapped on a train that's heading to Busan there are zombies on the train in certain cars as well as trying to board the train from the outside and our cast of characters has to try to get through the train to safety without being turned or killed by the zombies in a sub-genre of horror like zombie movies that's so overdone I honestly thought there were no great ways to do a zombie film left train to Busan proved me wrong this is one of the best zombie movies ever made one of the reasons this film works so well is not just because of all of the genre thrills and the stuff that will please us gore hounds that it has in spades but it's an emotionally powerful movie it finds ways to pit our characters in situations that are so overwhelming and it creates solutions and sometimes problems for our leads that are so heartbreaking that I found myself nearly tearing up this is a very emotionally satisfying movie it's it's devastating at times no spoilers if you've never seen it but this film is heart-wrenching it's not just a movie about fun fight scenes in the middle of a train which I thought it was as I press play but from the beginning you recognize the talent in the writing and the directing we have a father going through a divorce and he's visiting his daughter for her birthday and all she wants is to see her mom so they get on a train to go see her but the way they set everything up is so beautifully subtle the opening scene is a random guy hitting a deer and he's like oh [ __ ] and he just drives off and they slowly pan to the right to this deer and it just starts contorting and it's bones are breaking and it gets up and it's eyes are white and you're like holy [ __ ] such an effective opening and from there on the movie never lets up whether it's building character in a very smart way or it's building suspense train to Busan is brilliant at all so sets up great side-characters there's a homeless man who boards the train and at first you're kind of scared of him he seems like he might be infected himself and you don't know what he's going to do throughout the course of the movie my favorite character in the movie is a father-to-be whose wife is pregnant he's very sarcastic and he's at first put off by our main characters selfishness and that's one of the other things about this movie that I was so impressed with from the start of the movie within the first 20 minutes as far as the main character the father I thought to myself if he were to die early on I wouldn't really feel too bad but over the course of the movie they develop him so well and every character gets a great emotional arc over the course of this zombie train movie that could easily be a DVD on the bottom of a barrel and [ __ ] Walmart right now but it's not because they really gave great attention to these characters and by the end of the film I was so invested in this guy everyone in the movie gets a great arc and there's villains on this train that are 10 billion times worse than the zombies there's this one guy who's so incredibly selfish he wants to lock himself away and sequester everyone that he believes to not be infected in one side of the Train while other people who clearly are totally fine he does not want to let the men he's willing to endanger their lives and so similar to snowpiercer another South Korean movie on a train there's social commentary present throughout this entire movie about the way certain people sequester themselves off from others speaking purely from a genre perspective the b-movie thrills are astonishing there are so many amazing sequences the stunt people contorting their bodies and throwing themselves all around is extremely impressive there's a mind-blowing shot an aerial shot of all of these zombies attaching themselves to a train trying to stop it I had my mouth dropped my friend looked over at me and started laughing because I was just staring at the [ __ ] screen so blown away by the filmmaking there's a great sequence where they have to get from from train to train they found a unique and clever way for them to get past the zombies or fight the zombies in some way you get some great action scenes but then they also use their and figure out ways to get past the zombies this entire film impressed me from start to finish and it left me emotionally affected very deeply I I sat for a while and thought I I would not change a frame of this movie it's one of my favorite zombie movies I'm gonna give train to Busan and a plus if you've never seen the film it's on Netflix please do check it out as far as a zombie movie on the train okay just that as a concept cannot be done better they they pulled no punches with this movie this could have easily been snakes on a plane but they [ __ ] owned the characters in this movie they they wrote such compelling people with real relationships that the zombie stuff was just the icing on the cake guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this

"""https://youtu.be/3kNJxsi7Ii0""",Greyhound,Greyhound was directed by Aaron Schneider and stars Tom Hanks and comes out on Apple TV Plus this Friday from a screenplay that Tom Hanks wrote early in World War two and experienced US Navy captain must lead an allied convoy being stalked by Nazi u-boat wolf pack's this film was initially pushed back and then eventually because of the pandemic it is now being dropped on Apple TV plus Hanks wrote the script as I said the last time he wrote a movie was Larry Crowne a film he also directed he also wrote and directed that thing you do so this is not the first time he's ever written a screenplay but this is the first time he's written a screenplay that he did not direct get lo the 2009 film was the last time Aaron Schneider made a movie I was 11 years ago this is also the first time that Hanks has ever tackled writing a film of this nature his previous two films were very light-hearted movies whereas this is more of a somber film about the horrors of war unfortunately for me basically nothing about this movie really connects the characterization being one of the weakest elements there's one scene earlier on in the film where Tom Hanks is talking with Elizabeth Shue a woman he would like to marry but he's got to go out on his boat mission so he asked to leave her back home he has a Bible on the boat he prays a lot and from time to time his feet bleed as far as characterization goes that's it and it's a film that keeps asking us to care about characters who are being thrown into life-threatening situations but we don't because we have no idea who any of them are my friend who watched the film with me described it as relentless but repetitive there's basically non-stop situations that keep occurring there'll be one u-boat that's firing upon them and then here comes a torpedo from another one and when that's done there's a fire they have to put out and maybe one of the captain's friends died along the way and it's like that constantly without anything new there's nothing compelling thrown into the mix when you think about other films of this nature like say Hunt for Red October that's a movie that has all of the things that this movie has but it also has Sean Connery as someone who may or may not be defecting from his country and you don't know what his plans are there's a lot of mystery there and when you throw Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan into the mix suddenly things are really exciting or from say Crimson Tide with Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman that's a movie about nuclear bombs that's on a submarine one man believes I need to launch these things the other man is like no you [ __ ] don't that's really exciting and what's interesting is that Greyhound has almost wall-to-wall action a lot more action than films like crimson tide or Hunt for Red October but it has none of the character or the drama of the situations that those films do and so because of that the film feels really dull Greyhound is a movie about ordinary heroism now obviously the men who really went on these missions are to be commended of course but not everything has to be a movie there's a reason that movies like hacksaw Ridge get made or Schindler's List because it takes an extraordinary situation or an extraordinary person who did something massive in the face of all-out evil whereas in this movie Tom Hanks plays a captain who deals with a lot of life-threatening situations as best as possible there's nothing terribly Investing about that and since the characterization is so weak the film overcompensates with constant plot and constant situations because there is no character so the plot has to control what these people do because they're basically just mannequins who are operating this boat and the direction has nowhere near as much energy as it should it's a film that feels like it should really be moving especially since there's so many things always happening but it never feels that way because the film's idea of characterization is when Tom Hanks is writing a letter his pencil breaks and he's got to sharpen it yeah that's good all right I'll keep writing or the cook on the ship who keeps preparing meals for Tom Hanks because he notices that he's not eating and he just keeps making meals over and over again and Tom Hanks never eats them it's very awkward actually I knew there was an issue when I saw that a World War 2 era war film on a boat with Tom Hanks is only 90 minutes long that's a bit of a red flag the best way that I can describe Greyhound is that it's probably going to be your Grandpa's favorite new movie I'm gonna give Greyhound a see this is just a very dull movie and I can understand why they decided to release it on Apple TV Plus because it's the type of movie that you wha and you respect and then you instantly forget about it has no staying power guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to my Indiana Jones series continuing this weekend on Sunday I'll have a review for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom you guys are the best thank you again for watching and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck mine eyes

"""https://youtu.be/tcyLnU8i968""",Relic,relic was directed by Natalie Erika James this is her feature debut it had its premiere at Sundance earlier this year and this weekend it's gonna be showing at some drive-ins as well as VOD on July 10th Emily Mortimer plays Kay a woman who's going back to her mother's house because she's very concerned about her health and well-being she brings along her daughter Sam played by Bella Heathcote and she uncovers something very dark and disturbing about her mother as well as the house this film is going to be compared to the babadook quite often both films deal with a similar subject matter a woman who's dealing with some kind of mental issue and it's manifesting itself in a physical way or in a way that can be seen it's changing the environment around it it's obviously an inspiration to Relic and although I wouldn't say that it in any way rips off the babadook it's certainly the easiest way to explain this movie because relic is a movie that is going to split and divide some people I think that if you go into relic expecting a straightforward horror film with a ghost a demon or a monster you're going to be disappointed just as the people who watched the babadook who wanted to see a monster who wanted to have something jump out of the shadows were disappointed relics story is far more metaphorical it's much more of an allegory we're watching an older woman whose mind is deteriorating and the environment around her is literally deteriorating and her granddaughter and daughter respectively are witnessing this and because of the personal attention to detail and the fact that this situation is very familial it feels all the more disturbing sometimes you do see something physical manifest itself in the house and you're wondering what that could be at least for the first act because the film does a good job of keeping what's going on a mystery for a while it has some side stories and you're wondering if there's any connection there's a neighbor who says that they were locked in a closet in this house for a while and they can see scratch marks on the doors inside that closet there's a lot of attention given to windows that were reinstalled from another place into this house and you're wondering if that brought something here if something has attached itself to this house but once you uncover what's actually going on the film becomes more unsettling because like all good horror films the horror doesn't necessarily come from jump scares or sound effects or a terrifying image it's really based around the characters you feel more afraid in horror if you care about the people you're watching because you start to feel fear for them and in this film I did care about these characters because I understood this scenario very well watching someone you love lose their mind and Natalie Erika James finds clever ways to show these things depicted on the screen physically how can you show an older woman losing her mind from the lens of horror well she might grab her family binder filled with photos and just feel the need to bury it outside in this fit of rage that's a really really great idea and this movie is filled with those Emily Mortimer is also fantastic in the movie as is Bella Heathcote but the standout here is Robin Nevin as Edna she has moments where she's lucid and she's able to speak to her daughter and granddaughter and she seems totally normal and then she has these fits of rage anger and sadness that are really terrifying to watch this is a really brilliant actress she does a fantastic job in the movie there's also a slow building creeping horror during the first act that I found really effective it's exactly the way I like my first action horror to be tons of unanswered questions you have no idea what's going on for a long time and I like when if filmmaker respects the audience like that they'd let you go on a journey they let you have unanswered questions and they trust that you're not gonna shout at the screen if you don't get those answers immediately but the film had a few missteps for me is in the concept behind what this house and the thing that is essentially tormenting this woman's mind and her daughter and granddaughter how they show that just how much power it has how much ability it has there are times where you see a shadowed silhouette form walking around following people and I thought that maybe overstepped the boundaries a little bit of their rules that sort of made it seem all-powerful like it could just do anything there's a sequence where a hallway just keeps shrinking and shrinking and a woman who's trying to crawl through it just finds herself trapped in a dead end I understand the meaning behind this sequence but one of the issues I had with it is that in the babadook for instance we know that this creature is basically a manifestation of this woman's grief and depression and it pretty much solely affects her whereas in this movie this thing seems like I can do anything and it can leave the room go away from the older woman encounter the daughter and the granddaughter and it just feels like the rules aren't exactly clear the same time dementia affects the entire family not just the person suffering from it and so I can understand that too and if that was the excuse that filmmakers used while they were making the movie I guess that would work for me it's just that while you're watching it the first time it can seem unclear the the message or the point for a while because it seems like there's a thing that's following them around until you realize what's really going on under the surface so don't go into Relic expecting a monster movie or a ghost movie because you're going to be disappointed it's a film with a very very polarizing ending that I thought was really brilliant and it's gonna make a lot of people talk I'm gonna give Relic a B+ guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to my for Indiana Jones reviews I'm about to start reviewing all four of the movies starting with Raiders look forward to that in a few days guys are the best as always thank you so much as

"""https://youtu.be/lZEHxBpbIuI""",You Should Have Left,you should have left was written and directed by David Koepp and stars Kevin Bacon and is about a man and his family they go to a secluded house in Wales he's had a difficult past there's a crime that some people believe he committed but he has always maintained his innocence and while they're at this house strange things start to happen writing appears in his notebook that he's positive he didn't write hallways seemed to stretch on endlessly and a mystery develops about the house that he tries to solve I was really looking forward to this movie I'm a fan of David Koepp I like a lot of his films that he has written and some that he's directed as far as directing goes stir of echoes which also stars Kevin Bacon is really good I like secret window a lot and as far as writing goes spider-man panic room Jurassic Park I've really enjoyed a lot of his screenplays some of them are not as good though Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull being a prime example you should have left as a plum house production and in some ways it follows all of the rules that Blum House looks for a scare every 10 minutes or so secluded location limited cast certain things that Blum house always wants this movie fits into those guidelines very well but at the same time it doesn't and I'll get into that this was a vastly disappointing film for me in a way I approach the movie almost like it was a mash-up between secret window and stir of echoes to kept films the IMDB synopsis still as I sit here recording this review describes this movie as a screenwriter who's going to a secluded place to finish a film that he's writing and then crazy [ __ ] happens and I thought to myself well that's basically a secret window except in secret window Johnny Depp plays a novelist at a secluded location kind of losing his mind and it's got the same team from stir of echoes so it's basically secret window and stir of echoes combined this movie's gonna be awesome unfortunately this film is nothing like those movies not just in quality but in story he's definitely not a screenwriter I don't know why that's still on IMDB the original book this film was based off is about a screenwriter and that synopsis seems to be written from the book synopsis not the actual film as Forrest Kevin Bacon's character he's basically a nobody he's defined entirely by an event in his past we know so little about basically described to us by his wife as they talked to their young daughter she learns about it for the first time and she figures out her father's history and it's this moment that's supposed to sort of develop the story but it does very little for us it's a movie filled with non characters Amanda Seyfried Seyfried I never get her name right she is also an on character she plays an actress and that's really it she has no history she has very little development she's basically there as a device to get Kevin Bacon alone in the house sometimes technically this is a haunted house movie but the entire thing is shot in one of the most unscary looking houses I've seen in film recently this is a super modern sleek [ __ ] la looking design if I've ever seen one it's extremely well lit too there's light everywhere you expect darkness in a haunted house movie or a horror film or just a plain old scary movie which this is trying to be there's a sequence early on where he's going around the house turning off all the lights figuring out where all the light switches are and even as he turns them off there's still too much light I was never scared once during the 93 minutes of this movie in fact it takes an hour literally one hour before they start to discover a mystery about the house they start measuring the walls on the inside and the outside and they discover that inside there's more room than on the outside how does that happen and I was like okay that's kind of [ __ ] interesting if only that didn't happen an hour into the movie and maybe like 20 or 25 minutes and we're at the end of the second act start of the third and we're just now discovering some things about this house for that first hour every single scare is built around a dream sequence the film opens with a double dream sequence someone wakes up and then someone wakes up again and I instantly was like oh boy so since in the original book the main character was a screenwriter I can only assume that kept decided to scrap that because he already made secret window which was about a novelist kind of losing his mind in a secluded space so I'm assuming he was like I don't want to repeat myself so I'll scrap that instead we get nobody I have no idea who Kevin Bacon is in this movie or what he does or what he wants to do what his dreams and hopes are I have I have no idea since his wife is an actress I guess the assumption is is that she makes the money and he stays at home okay we're in 2020 I understand that happens but for a main character in a movie to have no goals no thoughts no aspirations he doesn't seem to want to do anything except go on a vacation it's a really boring character eventually the film does find an emotional core of some kind and it starts to feel more like a drama and less like a horror and it feels like kept couldn't really land on either one while making them it's great to have drama in horror and all great horror does but when your film seems largely about a drama and a family dispute of domestic dispute of some kind that's not gonna work for a scary movie it eventually becomes less about you should have left this haunted house and more of you should leave your haunted marriage and that's interesting but it's too little too late and I didn't care about these characters before and you're not gonna magically get me to care about them now there's also tons of unanswered questions in the movie and it seems to fall back on what 1408 fall back on which was we're in a crazy [ __ ] up location and anything can happen right that works in 1408 there was such a great setup between samuel l.jackson and John Cusack in that movie and it was also just a really [ __ ] good movie with a great character that I understood and I cared about whereas in this movie so many things happen like a long walking sequence with animal growls coming out of the woods and you you never really learned what that was all about I guess we're just supposed to assume it was animals and this long walking sequence ends up in a location and you're like okay I saw that coming a mile away and that felt very 1408 as well those unexplained notes in his book one of them is explained sort of the there isn't and even in their attempt to explain it it doesn't really make sense for why it happened when you start to really think about it it throws in this unnecessary sci-fi element to it that just makes the whole thing feel really convoluted and it's super undercooked you never really learn anything about it it's just this quick moment that seems almost like it was just a throwaway thing all of a sudden the film is basically a mashup a 1408 secret window and stir of echoes all films I like but it's just spare parts there's none of the ingenuity of their previous collaboration and it's also filled with entry-level scares for a horror movie shadows passing in front of the lens what is this place oh it was worth my 20 bucks for [ __ ] sake slamming doors dream sequences it feels like kept hasn't had to impress a studio since the early 90s it seems like once he got Jurassic Park made it was like okay I'm good I don't have to impress anyone ever again but he still made good films into the mid-2000s his last film he directed Mordecai and now this I feel like he hasn't really had to work to get a script made in years and I could be wrong but if this were a spec script from an unknown writer it would get [ __ ] shredded and never passed on to anyone if you emailed this script to an executive or to an agent they wouldn't even respond to you they would just throw it in a pile holy [ __ ] this movie actually kind of pissed me off a little bit I'm gonna give you should have left Addie Blum house has got to realize they are only as good as those prestige filmmakers that they work with and that they just let do their thing like Leigh Whannell you know I mean Leigh Whannell is super talented The Invisible Man upgrade insidious saw that's real talent but when you have movies like Fantasy Island and this truth or dare and all these shitty black Christmas like you're they're only as good as the people that work with them unfortunately you got to try harder bloom house love you but you gotta try harder guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon Wow I guess if you get me really excited for a movie that has like all the ingredients and then I watch it and I think I know 10 people who could have done that better and would have taken 25% of the pay that that kept probably took it just gets under my skin guys thank you so much as always for watching I look forward to more views very soon and if you like this you can click

"""https://youtu.be/_HEcnacyI_8""",The Vast of Night,the vast of night is a brand new film that just premiered on amazon prime this weekend it's andrew patterson's first film and this is a micro budget movie it's about a radio dj and a switchboard operator in 1950s new mexico that come across a strange signal that's coming through their system and they soon begin to realize that something might be hovering over their small town this film opens with a slow push in on a 1950s television and on that television is a sort of faux twilight zone intro with somebody who sounds like rod serling and it actually displays the film's title the vast of night within this intro and then we zoom into the tv we become part of that tv and now we're watching the film and that intro tells you everything you need to know about this movie if you like the outer limits or the x-files or twilight zone or any of those paranormal shows that explore these types of events you're probably going to enjoy this movie because this film feels like a tribute to all of them as already said this is a very low budget movie and what andrew patterson and his team does with the camera is very impressive you can see where they have to make certain caveats for their budget there's very long takes there's like a nine minute take of the switchboard operator just going back and forth between calls trying to decipher what a noise is and if you can get your actor to do that 10-minute take okay good move on you've finished that scene let's get going the film is broken up into various stories that they hear from people who call into the radio or people who they actually go and interview them and record them thinking this might be important and those stories are also usually told with very long takes you can see that they're trying to conserve time and where sometimes that might get boring or you might feel like they're conserving time and it's not really working for the pacing in the case of this movie the stories are so creepy and they're actually very well acted that it doesn't matter you just get engrossed in the story and it breaks some rules in that way at least some rules for first-time writers you often hear about if not too much storytelling eliminate long blocks of text that are on your page that stand out i'm assuming if they showed this script to people for notes they probably got a lot of feedback about really long blocks of text of dialogue that's understandable but in a film like this it really works because this movie captures the sort of live wire immediacy of a few people in a small town stumbling across something monumental and so they're going to talk about it and they're going to share their expertise about it but when they aren't saving time with really long takes they utilize some really fun and inventive camera work there's a shot that tracks from the switchboard all the way to the radio station through the entire town and i read an interview with the director where he talked about how they accomplished that shot and he said that one of the things they did was they gave the camera to an 18 year old on a go-kart and he just sped through the town capturing this amazing footage they utilize a basketball court to its full capacity every single extra is showcased in full for that sequence because as much money as you can make people think you spent on a scene you might as well make them think you spent it this is really impressive filmmaking and a lot of it works you can see that they are desperate to make a movie and they're doing their best to make a film that they can within their means but it's actually kind of suspenseful this movie is basically made for me uh my mom and i used to watch movies like this all the time because like a lot of great movies that are about some sort of paranormal event they focus on a few characters who are encountering this for the first time and they're sort of in the middle of this crazy event that they don't understand and they're all just running to catch up sometimes very literally running to catch up and so the movie feels very in the moment and i've always loved films that take place in a contained period of time that's something i'd really like to do one day as to is to make a film that that's all just one [ __ ] up night you know i'm i'm actually trying really hard to accomplish that right now so my biggest recommendation to you is to not watch this film assuming you're going to get this gigantic alien invasion movie like independence day where ships are coming out of the clouds and blasting cities this is a super small scale movie and they utilized every single thing at their disposal to make the film as for issues with the movie some of the color grading could have been a lot better the darker aspects of the image in certain scenes they would look very brown and washed out and there would be a lot of glow from car headlights that accomplished this and it wasn't very visually attractive and there were other scenes where the darker parts of the shot looked great so the color grading i think could have used a little more work um the lighting was too dim in certain scenes actors didn't have enough eye light and so sometimes you couldn't really see their emotions and reactions to things and that's really important especially in a long like 10 minute take a lot of that you can tell is due to budget but i can absolutely say that if this filmmaker is given a little more money and and more of a crew next time i'm extremely excited to see what he does i'm going to give the vast of knight an a minus please keep in mind this is a grade given to a film where i am recognizing their limitations that's something you really have to think about when you walk into a movie like this this is not going to be like other films that have millions of dollars at their disposal and for what they had and what they accomplished i was extremely impressed and i can highly recommend this movie it was also turned down by a surprising amount of festivals including sundance and a whole bunch of other festivals and i'm very surprised granted there's no names in this movie and for most everyone involved with the film it was their first project so i can understand why some of those bigger festivals don't care anymore about movies like that because they've kind of moved on to like looking for names which in a way is its own kind of bullshitty thing that maybe i'll talk about one day but besides that please do check out this movie on amazon prime i think it deserves to be supported especially by indie filmmakers and people who want to make movies it's very inspiring guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and

"""https://youtu.be/gQgAnkqNTLg""",Scoob!,Scoob comes to us from multiple different people there are three storied bye credits and four screenplay buy credits some of their credits include alvin and the chipmunks the road chip rampage and playing with fire here we get to see a young Shaggy adopt scooby-doo when he was a little puppy he was a stray and shaggy had no friends they eventually met Fred Daphne and Velma and they went on supernatural mystery excursions together as you may have seen from the original TV show or any of the spin-off shows or the two live-action feature films but this time around this guy named Dick Dastardly voiced by Jason Isaacs finds out that scooby-doo is like the ancient ancestor to some kind of something and Scooby has to touch he's got it he has to touch something that activates a portal i watch scooby-doo occasionally when I was a kid but it was never like a mainstay of my household and the reason why is because I was always pissed off that whatever it was they were chasing ended up being a guy wearing a suit I always wanted the ghost or the werewolf or the vampire to be [ __ ] real I didn't want it to be a guy in a goddamn suit crying about those meddling kids that's why I liked watching shows like goosebumps are you afraid of the dark or the x-files shows where the paranormal stuff was real in the confines of the show I didn't like how in scooby-doo it was always fake so when it comes to this movie they have a mixture of both they have some people who are pretending to do things and there are some actual supernatural elements to the film which was a pleasant surprise the movie is Wow I'm actually trying to find good things to say about it and I'm running out Frank Welker as the voice of scooby-doo is fine I think that might be it I've never seen a in control of an IP a property in this case scooby-doo be so ashamed of its property this movie does not want to be anything like scooby-doo it is aggressively modern in every way it's filled with a lot of today's songs they try to rap a superhero Avengers like plot into this thing where they meet up with Blue Falcon voiced by Mark Wahlberg and his super dog dynomutt and they go on adventures in a ship shaggy and Scoob gets separated from Fred Daphne and Velma people that you only really got about 10 to 15 minutes with in the opening of the movie as kids then we cut to them older and they're apparently a team now and the first scene we get with them is an argument where Simon Cowell appears that suggests that maybe the team doesn't work well together and Simon Cowell ruins their French then they separate and Shaggy and Scoob are off on their superhero adventure while everyone else is trying to figure out where they went you never really get a sense of these characters within this movie the movie really wants you to have seen every show every spin-off and every other film involving these characters as if that was somehow backstory when it's not this movie is a fresh start we have a little tiny opening with shaggy and Scoob getting to know each other and then for the rest of the movie all the characters are basically separated and you don't know a goddamn thing about them they're just the caricatures that you expect them to be from the show there's nothing new or interesting about this movie it's taking a property that most people like and just trying to make it fit into 2020 and it doesn't in a really cringe-worthy way another thing that was weird was the timeframe where are we supposed to be like the movie opens with shaggy as a little boy and the first thing you hear is Tupac's California love and then somebody goes by on rollerblades holding a boom box playing that song and I was like okay so is it's like the 90s or something okay shaggy is a little boy I get it's the 90s but then he pulls out a smartphone and I was like wait where are we what time is this then we cut to them as like adults and I'm like okay is this is this in the future future or is this now and what the [ __ ] just happened explain it to me Scooby okay full disclosure before quarantine I had no plans to review this movie but now you know desperate for new content and it's released on Amazon I paid $20 for it I had to watch this movie in increments I found it so so so boring and so completely uninteresting that I just I could barely sit down and watch the whole thing I had to watch 10 minutes here and there move around the house go from the phone to the TV I just I couldn't watch this entire movie in one sitting I found it so so uninvolved uhma stucking thing I've seen this year it really is I've seen a lot of dumb [ __ ] this year Nicole Brown Simpson movie and the best way I can describe it is just to say what I already have which is they have an IP that people like but they clearly see all these problems with it and they try to keep certain things like the 1960s van the Mystery Machine but it's taking place in today with these kids who are talking about smart phones and saying like modern day social media buzzwords all throughout their movie but they have all these 1960s things as well and they're trying to find a way to mash it all up to somehow make kids today not be bored but kids today still watch Scooby Doo and they're not [ __ ] bored like there's new scooby-doo cartoons that little kids like to watch I've just never seen a company be so ashamed of their IP that they just try to change it drastically to make kids today like it when it was already fine before I'm gonna give Scoob a d guys thank you so much as always for watching I'll be back very soon with some movies I'm sure you actually want me to talk about oh man I have a few hilarious ATI's I've already shot and edited those are gonna be

extraction was directed by Sam Hargrave and stars Chris Hemsworth as a mercenary that's tracking down the son of a drug lord that was kidnapped in India but as his mission turns deadly very quickly he begins to realize this kid has sought after by a lot more people than he originally thought this film premiered on Netflix today and I gave it a watch because it's written by Joe Russo produced by him and his brother Anthony and it's directed by Sam Hargrave the veteran stunt coordinator of the Avengers movies some of the Pirates of the Caribbean films he's been around doing stunt work for a while and this is his first time behind the camera and in the past I would have been like who's stunt man making a movie but ever since the John wick films I don't take anything for granted and his past work as a stunt coordinator is obvious throughout this movie the action scenes are mind-blowing there are at least a couple scenes in this movie that are some of the best hand-to-hand combat I've seen recently in a movie there's one in particular that's about an 11 minute simulated one take you can tell where some of the cuts are but the effect is pretty seamless and this sequence in particular has the potential to be an all-timer in regards to action scenes I think this movie will be studied by stunt coordinators and people who want to work as stunt people it's an extremely violent movie Chris Hemsworth is killing [ __ ] left and right ripping off heads throwing people into brick walls tossing people around people are getting hit by trucks and just [ __ ] flying into the air it's really really fun stuff if you're an action movie junkie and despite its VOD like title a title that seems like it would star Michael Madsen and Bruce Willis and be at the bottom of a bin at your local Walmart this movie was a lot better than I expected it to be I'll put it this way I've turned off a lot of Netflix movies way through I didn't turn this one off all that being said it will definitely not be studied for its characterization or its subtlety or its plot this is a very bare-bones plot chris hemsworth is a mercenary he's got a bit of a traumatic past he's been hired to track down this kid and bring him to safety the movie doesn't try to be too much else it knows exactly what it is and it's pretty good at being that and it's pretty okay with being that if this was being written by a spec writer someone who isn't Joe Russo someone who wants to get into the business it would probably be thrown back into their face saying look this is just some straight-to-dvd [ __ ] you're never gonna get this made just forget it but since Joe Russo's behind it and Anthony Russo the film got made and obviously this is the Avengers team figuring out how to make a cool action movie that could be on Netflix and I'm excited for Sam Hargrave forgetting to direct this movie because he shows a real flair for this type of action work but there's definitely something to be said about the fact that movie doesn't really have that much else to offer beyond the action scenes and Chris Hemsworth's extreme likability and charisma in the lead role he's very good in the film he does a lot of the stuff himself the stunt team again I must say is just remarkable in this movie and they can't be given enough praise but if you don't really care that much about action films and you'd rather be invested in the characters in the situation and the drama of the moment you're not going to get as much of that although they do give about as much as they can to a plot that is as fast as this there's enough of a backstory for Chris Hemsworth to get invested in him and to feel for him in a way we've kind of strayed away from the Cobras and the Predators of the 80s where heroes spouted one-liners and now we have really tragic backstories for our main characters instead there's still some fun to be had in this movie but I can understand why some people might actually think it's a little too violent that's not a problem for me though I don't watch a movie like this expecting it to be tame and in a world where everyone loves John wick I'm surprised that so many critics have actually complained about the violence well I can understand it does surprise me I have a feeling it's probably because John wick is a more pulpy experience it's a little more fun extraction is more hard edged although the action is over-the-top it feels a little more plausible and so it's a little harder to disconnect from the fact that you're watching a movie and in some ways some of the violence in the movie might bother some it didn't bother me it's a movie it's a fiction and although I don't really expect that much more than some great action out of a movie called extraction directed by a stunt coordinator I would have liked to have seen a lot more characterization given to the kid that he's rescuing Hemsworth gets some you understand his backstory eventually and you can relate to him but the kid he likes to play piano he occasionally moves his fingers on his knee like he's playing piano to calm himself down but besides that you don't really know that much about him he's a son of a ruthless crime lord what's his life like what's it like being the son of a crime lord having a target on your back just to get at your dad that's interesting and they don't explore enough of that I think that could have really helped a movie still there's in particular that 11-minute one-take scene and then there's like a hand-to-hand combat scene where Hemsworth is just tossin dudes around a brick building really amazing stuff and I found myself pretty riveted by the action scenes but you're not gonna get that level of attention with the characters in this movie and sometimes I can really be in the mood for one of those I'm gonna give extraction a B it's on Netflix right now give it a watch if you just want to watch some really great action scenes I think this movie delivers for the most part guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck mine eyes ,1
"""https://youtu.be/ed7Hr5J-whY""",Bad Education,a weekend with new movies that I can actually talk about and watch this is extremely exciting to me for some reason the notion of watching a new film even though we can't go to our glorious church of the theater right now it's amazing to be able to actually watch some new movies bad education was directed by Cory Finley and stars Hugh Jackman Ray Romano and Alison Janie and it's a true story of a beloved superintendent of New York's Rosalind School District his friends and relatives and staff become the prime suspects in the unfolding of the single largest public school embezzlement scandal in American history this film premiered on HBO this Saturday and I got a chance to watch it because I still have my leftover HBO GO account from my Game of Thrones binging that ended so wonderfully by the way and having enjoyed Korey Finley's last films thoroughbreds I was excited to watch this movie and I think this is a major step up from even that film bad education is a brilliant movie with extremely excellent writing from mike mckowski who actually was a student at the high school that this movie depicts so he has a first-hand account of some of these events and understands the fallout hugh jackman as Frank test zone plays a superintendent that everyone loves everybody is inspired by this person he remembers all of the students names very easily he knows what all of the kids want to do he will make time for anyone he will sit down with any student and make sure that they feel like they are loved and that they feel like they're protected he even runs into older students he hasn't seen in years and remembers exactly what they wanted to do with their life by all accounts he's excellent at his job he is perfect at his job except for one very specific and very illegal thing and when a young student who works for the school's paper starts to investigate where the school's funds are going she starts to uncover some very concerning things I found this movie absolutely riveting Hugh Jackman is an incredible actor I've loved him in mini movies prisoners being one of the first times where I truly didn't see Hugh Jackman he just became another person on the screen he's such a gifted actor and bad education might just be competition for his best work there's one particular scene in this movie that is so so striking of a performance there's a scene in this film where he just [ __ ] rocks every minute that he is on screen and it is so enthralling to watch this actor deserves a lot of [ __ ] praise for this performance I could easily see this being nominated for Best Actor next year especially since right now there's really not a lot of competition for that unless you count Jim Carrey but not to be overlooked as Alison Janie who again is just [ __ ] phenomenal these two performers are operating on another level they just disappear you don't see him they're so so good in this film and it's a story that is is very relevant especially with the recent college admissions scandal that happened this story takes place in 2002 and it's one of those stories that you would really have a hard time believing unless it was true when people are so loved and so liked by their town and by the residents there and every kid at the school loves these teachers and the administrative people it's really easy for them just go well you know that's a little weird but I'm just gonna overlook it because this guy just is so nice to my kid and that's where this reporter comes in which apparently is a slightly invented character a sort of amalgamation of various different people it is true that the school paper originally started to look into the things that other papers picked up on and the story really broke but that's a bit of an invention of a character but I can see why because it adds a lot of suspense and tension to the movie as she's investigating these things and it also assists the audience because we're able to kind of sift through these things through her eyes and it helps us as viewers make sense of everything Ray Romano is also great in this movie I'm so glad that he's like apparently back after welcome to Mooseport I was like are we never gonna see Ray Romano again but after the irishman and this I mean he's really delivering a lot of good performances right now as for issues the first 20 minutes of the movie can feel a bit like where is this going there are times where you're not entirely sure what the film is about you're used to getting that big opening scene or that moment in the first 10 to 15 minutes that jump starts the story but in this case there's a lot of setup you have to understand what all of these characters are doing for the community to feel the weight and the impact of the betrayal that happens later in the movie as soon as is that sort of jump starts the movie gets really interesting and I was invested immediately in fact I watched this movie before bed last night and I was like oh I'll watch like half of it and then I'll go to bed and I'll watch the rest tomorrow about 30 40 minutes into the movie I was like god damn I'm gonna be up too late because I was just totally hooked and the other thing is that at one point in the movie there's sort of like an imaginative dream sequence that a character envisions and it felt so against the grain of what the rest of the movie was like the entire film feels very realistic and grounded and then there's sort of like this imagined fantasy and I was sort of detached all of a sudden besides that I think this is some of the best acting maybe the best acting of Hugh Jackman's career Alison Janie is incredible in the movie the writing is really good and so is the directing I'm gonna give bad education and a - like I said it's on HBO right now if you have access to HBO I would highly suggest watching it it's definitely one of the better films I've seen so far this year guys thank you so much as always for watching and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck mine eyes ,2
"""https://youtu.be/GirRwBbiy7A""",Swallow,Swallow stars Haley Bennett as a newly pregnant woman named Hunter she's recently married into a family that's extremely rich she no longer has to work and her husband as well as his parents are extremely critical of just about everything she does and they don't really let her choose any element of her life she's very much out of control of her own life and that's about when she decides to swallow a marble yeah this is a weird movie I heard a lot about this film and I was eventually going to see it and Wow I don't think I've actually been this grossed out by a film in a very long time this film actually deeply disturbed me I had to watch it in segments which is rare for me I've seen a lot of in movies what makes this movie strange though is what you're not seeing you don't see what things that she's ingesting or doing to her body inside you just see the aftermath and you see how much this is traumatizing her and how much it's ruining her life because after that marble she starts to ingest a lot of things you're not supposed to eat batteries thumbtacks I won't get into any more you guys get the point and if you've ever had like a phobia of certain foods or you've had any eating disorders or anything like that this movie is gonna be really hard to watch but if you if you want to diet and you're like thinking of eating less this movie is definitely gonna help you do that Jesus Christ the film is beautifully shot the colors are immaculate it looks so good and without a doubt the best part of this film is Haley Bennett this is easily her best performance that I've seen anyway she's magnificent in this movie despite doing something that's a little hard to understand she makes all of it very believable and if you do some research you can find out that this is entirely realistic there are plenty of people who feel the need to do this and watching a person's life fall apart because of the one thing surrounded by some really horrible family stuff is excruciating this movie is very difficult to watch but I couldn't help but respect it because it was directed so well in the performances were so on point and you can definitely look deeper into the film beyond just the idea that a woman who's out of control of her own life and is clearly involved with a family that just doesn't really care about her you can look deeper than that and see a lot of metaphors and reasons for why she's doing the thing she's doing and how she's in a way through this horrific stuff reclaiming her own life but that's gonna be very subjective to the viewer because in some ways you can also look at the family and they're like what the hell are you doing and you're kind of like yeah what are you doing you know like it's you can side with them in a way too because even though they're sort of the villains they're concerned about this woman who's clearly doing something terrible to her body while she's pregnant and so in many ways you can understand why they're freaking out but you can also look at hailey Bennet's character and feel extremely sorry for her because she's under the thumb of these rich so it's a complex movie emotionally and psychologically she goes to a therapist and she reveals a lot about her past in these therapy sessions and you begin to realize there's a lot more to her than you at first thought and perhaps this compulsion that she's developed isn't just a selfish act there might be more behind that which makes the movie more interesting still my god this movie was difficult to watch and very disturbing for me to see but it was refreshing to see a movie that bothered me this much in fact I'll go as far as to say I was actually kind of hungry and ready to eat dinner before I watched the film and yeah I waited a few hours to eat I just had to it actually genuinely bothered me that much and I saw raw which I was able to eat while watching Raw so yeah this movies on another level in regards to like traumatizing demoralizing embarrassing just really up for some reason I don't know this specific thing it may have opened up a new phobia for me I'm gonna give swallow a B+ this movie is not for everyone I will say that right now this movie is 100% absolutely not for everyone it is not fun to watch this movie but it's very easy to respect it guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck mine eyes ,1
"""https://youtu.be/M6fT2j_Ebgk""",Licence to Kill,thank you so much as always for watching and if you like this oh [ __ ] license to kill stars Timothy Dalton as James Bond it was his second appearance after The Living Daylights and ended up being his final appearance in the role so when a drug lord that bond and felix both capture in the opening scene escapes he finds felix and brutally murders his wife and leaves felix for dead so bond goes rogue and seeks vengeance on those responsible as he infiltrates an organization posing as a hitman Timothy Dalton is a bond you don't hear as much about as some of the other actors he only did two films between the living daylights and license to kill but in my opinion he was one of the best to ever wear at the suit he was kind of a precursor to Daniel Craig's bond and although the public wasn't exactly in love with Roger Moore at first in his early films and were perhaps clamoring for Sean Connery to return once again his films eventually caught on to the public and he made a lot of Bond movies and they were successful financially but they were also very silly light-hearted films Timothy Dalton portrayal of bond was much more in line with Ian Fleming's original vision for this character a cold-blooded assassin as 2 million dollars in that suitcase I'll split it with you you want it you keep it and I don't know if the public was quite ready for that because license to kill was the very first pg-13 bond this movie has brutal kills people are eaten alive by sharks the main villain Sanchez is a ruthless Colombian drug lord who murders people in very violent ways even if you're on his side and you disappoint him he just might put you in a pressure chamber and explode your head the Bond films that directly preceded Living Daylights and license to kill felt very frivolous in nature compared to this movie this movie feels like there's actual stakes it feels like there's real danger there's moments where James is in these horrific scenarios that you expect him to get out at the last second but there are times in this movie where you're not exactly sure if that's gonna happen despite how much I enjoy the James Bond movies he doesn't usually feel like a human being daniel craig's bond changed that with Casino Royale and some of the better moments in Pierce Brosnan's filmography addressed certain things that other films haven't but for the most part most of the Bond films up until Timothy Dalton we're fun action movies you could go to with your date and eat popcorn and not really care there might be a laser coming for bonds crotch but you know he's gonna get out of there license to kill doesn't feel that way this movie feels like when people die they just [ __ ] die no one's gonna get up after they're crushed by a tanker truck at the time this was easily the most violent James Bond movie and we're not used to seeing bond like this his friend killed his other friend maimed throughout the movie other people he's close to are murdered and it takes a toll on him you can tell that it's eating him apart inside this revenge path that he's on is turning him into a different person and you can't tell if he's comfortable with that or not there's a lot of nuance to bond in this movie and I never really paid attention to his portrayal of bond for a long time until I watched all of the films and Roah and i could see just how much he brought to this role in just how much he was really trying to revolutionize his portrayal of this character it doesn't feel like anything else that had come before it and I just don't think the public was ready for it yet this film also took em and mi6 and Vaughn's relationship with them in a new direction because once they can tell that he's a loose cannon they force him into a meet up and revoke his license to kill and when he flees the scene and goes rogue it makes it feel like there's real consequences here it doesn't feel like everything's going to be okay we're gonna talk about the ending of the movie and get into some spoilers just to warn you and why I wish they had committed to that during the finale and before Benicio del Toro was shoving his balls in people's faces to intimidate them he was a villain and license to kill and he's very intimidating whenever he's on screen you can definitely see the talent waiting to blossom the action sequences here also feel more brutal even than the last film living daylights that film was rated PG and it still felt kind of safe and like an acceptable adventure your family could see this movie through all of that away and it's one of the lowest grossing James Bond films not a lot of people saw this one now even though this film is considerably more serious and takes a harder edged in the previous unfortunately towards the end it throws all that away bond gets a phone call from Felix Felix is fine he's like hey everything is cool hey em wants to talk to you about a job and he's like you know whatever hangs up and he goes and makes out with a girl I'm like really I mean like there's no consequences this movie felt like it was setting up a world in which there were dire consequences and for most of the film it backs that up until the ending it kind of just were supposed to leave and smile and have fun and it was a James Bond movie yeh it didn't mean anything that is unfortunate because this film was kind of poised for potential greatness and in some ways even the filmmakers weren't quite ready for that yet still I think this is a very good James Bond film I think it's very underrated as is Dalton's portrayal of the character but I do want to talk about the finale tanker chase this is a sequence that has a lot of crazy stunts some things happen that just don't really feel real like the truck like just does a [ __ ] wheelie all of a sudden I I'm not exactly sure why that happened yeah the stunt is practical but why the [ __ ] does the truck have the ability to do that that's the question but what I really want to talk about is the urban legend that surrounds this scene if you don't know about it supposedly nuns in a minibus went off a cliff and died on this stretch of road and the crew while filming this sequence was plagued with a lot of strange events one of the missiles that Sanchez fires apparently travelled a couple miles and hit somebody Timothy Dalton was almost killed during one of the truck stunts and the strangest thing by far and one of the creepiest things is the explosion that occurs at the end this really epic scene where bond takes the lighter that Felix gave him and light Sanchez on fire any [ __ ] burns alive really dark stuff love it then the tanker truck blows up there was a photographer on set that day and he took this picture that seems to show a hand coming out of the fire when you watch the movie and you see the explosion you can't really find that image anywhere when you go frame by frame so there's a lot of urban legends surrounding this finale tanker chase sequence and the stretch of road that they shot it on and that's the kind of stuff that I just I love looking into that that's very creepy to me I think that's really cool if you haven't seen Timothy Dalton's two Bond films I would recommend them I think this film is better a lot of people like living daylights more but I've always appreciated a license to kill a lot more I'm gonna give it a B+ guys thank you so much as always for watching I had a good time talking about these James Bond movies I'm gonna have a link in a second for the playlist you can watch all the ones I've done so far you guys are the best I'm looking forward to seeing that movie later this year I hope it's good thank you so much as always for watching and if you

"""https://youtu.be/MwV5kf6RuQs""",Trolls: World Tour,trolls World Tour is a new release movie thanks to Universal they released this movie on VOD and its original theatrical release date so in a way trolls world tour has made history this this movie is gonna be in the history books for at least that so this is the sequel to the surprisingly successful film that came out in 2016 when everyone was making movies about things a trend that may have finally died last year when Playmobil the movie came out and nobody saw it so poppy and branch discover that the pop trolls are one of six different troll tribes scattered over six different lands devoted to six different kinds of music funk country techno classical pop and rock all six have their own strings that are supposed to join together for one musical instrument whoever wields all of the strings has all of the power that being Thanos of course and queen barb of The Rock trolls is trying to steal all of the strings and wield that power I must say even though it's this movie it feels really nice to be talking about a new release I haven't talked about a new release in a while due to what's going on right now and even though I wasn't able to see this in theaters it was nice to be able to see the movie at home because this is not the type of film I am dying to see on a giant theater screen surrounded by screaming children in fact it was probably a blessing that I got to watch this at home with my wife and just kind of laugh at the absurdity of the whole thing I briefly mentioned it but this is obviously a riff on the Infinity stones that Thanos is trying to gather and it's kind of hard to miss especially when it's coming out right after endgame it's a little shameless it's not really that much of a parody it's just obviously that's what they're going for and they couldn't really figure out what to do with this movie you can tell for a lot of the film the first 10 minutes of the movie are basically a bunch of pop cover songs in the beginning there's a storybook voiceover that sums up the previous film just in case you forgot followed by a lot of covers and that's one of the biggest weaknesses of this movie actually those cover songs usually in animated musicals the songs tell the narrative they're original they're a way for the characters to express their emotions how they're feeling in that moment and you can experience their arc through their songs sometimes but in the case of this movie the majority of the songs are all covers from the 80s 90s and early 2000s so the overabundant song sequences that are almost constant and never-ending don't do anything for the characters they're just meant to make kids feel like they're experiencing constant sensation never getting bored as well as filling a lucrative soundtrack album a cover here and there is fine but when your entire movie feels like nothing but cover songs it can feel like a really empty experience the film's message is one of diversity and acceptance it's telling a story where the different music tribes all only like their music they don't like anyone else's music and the thought of joining their music with anyone else's music terrifies them and so it's a lot of different tribes that are separated from each other and of course the message is everyone should join their music and be united good message for kids to hear but this movie does not do it in a subtle way in fact it's kind of like Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake are in your ears screaming at you the whole movie and you wish you had the gumdrop earplugs that they use throughout the movie in fact if you're a parent showing your kids this movie over the next few weeks you're gonna wish you had those gumdrop earplugs the animation is obviously going to be great DreamWorks always does good stuff their animation looks beautiful it's very colorful it does feel like a drug trip you could probably watch this movie high or drunk and it would definitely enhance the experience but it just doesn't feel like it's a movie that earns its existence except for the fact that the first film made money kids liked it and it had a huge hit pop song at its center that I heard on the radio a thousand times a day every day for like two years and that was great the story of the movie is so bare-bones and it's centered around one message and one character that is so grating ly annoying that can't make one right decision to save her life that being Anna Kendrick's poppy the film just doesn't really feel like it has a reason to be a story and that's why there are so many cover songs throughout the course of the movie where the trolls just start singing because they don't know what else to do but talk about that character papi throughout this entire film she makes every wrong decision that you could possibly make she's so naive and so annoying you can see it from the very first wrong decision she makes and you're just pulling your hair out every time she makes a decision and the characters all around her are also going hey you're making dumb decisions and she's like I don't give a [ __ ] I'm the queen of pop and I'm a cool little toy troll thing and I'm gonna I'm I'm I'm taking this too seriously it's a type of movie that's constantly on something is always happening it's never down the energy is always so skyrocketed that when it actually slows down it's only ever to have a character-building moment have a lesson learned you never have these quiet moments that could actually tell a story unless it's to have some sort of argument between characters where they part ways and then you wait for them to be friends again the movie is so obsessed with making sure that the kids who watch it don't lose their attention span while doing so that it forgets to just have a story and by the time the ending rolls around and it gets so strangely dramatic all of a sudden and more unearned and very awkward cringe-worthy scenes it was kind of hard to sit through I was sitting there with my wife and we were actually like locking up somebody do something somebody say something this is weird why is this still happening oh my god I don't feel anything stop I don't feel anything stop pushing all of that aside honestly if you are at home right now and you have nothing else to do like most of us right now I'm sure there are worse things you could show your kids aside from sticking some songs into their head that they're going to be singing for the next few weeks and annoying the [ __ ] out of you possibly this movie isn't gonna do any damage it's just not for me and probably isn't for most of the people who view my channel but if you really loved the first trolls movie this is definitely not going to offend you it's probably going to give you exactly what you wanted but if you're like me it's not necessary to watch this at all and it doesn't earn its strangeness you know like the lego movie is a movie that felt unnecessary and then when we watched it it was strangely clever and really well made and it earned being a movie the trolls movie made money I don't really think for the viewer that earns watching the second one for DreamWorks okay they made another one because money but for everyone else it's another movie to be inundated with a lot of cover songs where you would rather listen to the originals and it's yet another toy or thing product movie that is gonna be forgotten in like a month if even I'm gonna give trolls world tour a c-minus still it is kind of strange that this movie could perhaps be mentioned throughout film history as a film that was going to go to theaters but move to VOD on the same day because of everything that's going on in the world right now it's sort of an unprecedented thing and

"""https://youtu.be/oJhuEHETIxs""",The World Is Not Enough,the world is not enough was Pierce Brosnan's third James Bond film coming after Tomorrow Never Dies and this film tells the story of a woman who finds herself entangled in a nuclear plot while James Bond tries to protect her from her former kidnapper an international terrorist who can't feel pain I actually had no plans to review the world is not enough I played the game a lot as a kid I saw the movie quite often when I was a kid my friends and I we all kind of had the VHS it was just one of those VHS is you had like he had Independence Day men and black possibly Godzilla and maybe Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies and world is not enough it was just one of those VHS is that everybody kind of had but I've been in a James Bond mood and I saw that it was on Netflix and so I sat down to watch it just for fun and I decided I wanted to talk about it this is a film that is strangely polarizing for James Bond fans there are many people that don't like twine as it is affectionately referred to in the fan community some people find it very boring and repetitive it doesn't really have the energy of Goldeneye and it has at least one horrific Lee bad performance that we'll talk about later but there are others that appreciate this film because it feels a little bit more like classical Bond this movie feels kind of like a Connery picture in some ways it doesn't feel as modern as Tomorrow Never Dies was especially since Tomorrow Never Dies was like let's have a tech mogul because everybody was afraid of technology leading to the year 2000 which is strange because this movie came out in 99 so you think they would hit it over the head even more in this movie there's one mention of the y2k bug in the film but for the most part this feels like an old-school Bond movie for some people they were done with that they didn't want that gold and I reinvented it and the fact that rule is not enough kind of took it back to a nuclear plots and there's a guy who can't feel pain cuz he has a bullet lodged in his brain but the film also has a lot of supporters because Pierce Brosnan's portrayal of bond in this movie is a lot darker he's also written darker he's meaner in this movie he's not quite as quippy as he was in Tomorrow Never Dies and certainly as he was and I another day but Brosnan's portrayal of bond is definitely darker in this film we're gonna get into some spoilers here so if you've never seen the movie that's your warning our main villain is this guy who can't feel pain but there's sort of like a sub villain that eventually appears from the character of Elektra King she is suffering from Stockholm Syndrome she has fallen in love with her kidnapper for a lot of the movie you don't know that and when that's revealed it's actually kind of gross you're like oh that's that's disgusting that's a very vile storyline the fact that this woman was kidnapped was forced into using her body in ways she did not want to and eventually came around to falling for her kidnapper that's really [ __ ] up the film doesn't really get a lot of credit for its darker themes and directly after she tries to torture and kill bond by using a machine that's slowly choking him he kills her right in front of him you wouldn't kill me miss me yes die so despite some of the one-liners and despite some of the more humorous scenes that are in the world is not enough they were attempting to go back to basics the script is not as good as it could be the villain is acceptable the action sequences are also acceptable they're nowhere near as good as goldeneye there's some serious staging issues in the final confrontation between bond and this guy who can't feel pain both actors are drenched in water more than likely the set was too and there's bars everywhere this was probably a nightmare to set up and shoot and you can tell while you watch it they can barely get around this set to make a convincing looking fight it's really awful but the storyline is rooted in more suspense and tension than Tomorrow Never Dies was there's action sequences galore in this movie and while some of them aren't that great like the skiing sequence which is okay at best due to some poor setups again this could be second unit directing issues I'm not entirely sure but there's a lot of action sequences in the movie that could have been great with a steadier hand behind the camera but I found myself mostly interested in this film because of that storyline the idea that this woman was kidnapped and eventually fell for her kidnapper and this betrayal that bond feels as a result it's not like the trails and Bond movies are new or anything they're very common but the movie also gives a lot of screen time to em and any screen time given to Judi Dench is a good thing she is taken captive in the movie and you get to see her trying to use her resourcefulness to get out of that captivity and there are things they did with the characters in this movie that I surprisingly like rewatching the film made me want to review it I was literally just gonna watch the movie and have it on like in the background and I kind of got invested I haven't seen the movie in a long time and I was surprised that I enjoyed the movie as much as I did because the film is by no means a favorite in fact most people don't like this movie and I can understand that but a couple years ago when I got that box set behind me I rewatched all of the Bond films in a row from dr. know all the way to believe Quantum of Solace was the newest one at that time because it was right before Skyfall came out and I got to watch the progression of the series and it was the best way for me to experience the Bond series just watching how all of them changed how some of them went back how some of them tried to go forward and how some of them were just absurd in the case of the world is not enough you can tell that there is definitely an attempt to go back to basics it's just that the script wasn't as good as it could have been let's talk about what is easily the thing that everybody can agree on whether or not you like this movie or not the casting of Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist okay you guys know that I get a little uncomfortable trashing actors in film in this case though I can't deal with it she is horrific in the film this is some of the worst acting I've ever seen in a big-budget movie it's absolutely embarrassing there are scenes where she's supposed to feel like she's about to die and her face is like a [ __ ] Stonewall nothing is moving here it is just pure bland it is a horrific ly bad performance and the casting choice seems entirely based on the fact that she is a beautiful woman easily one of the worst casting choices I have ever seen her dialogue and her delivery is all horrendous the fact that she's in this movie really really affects it poorly but Brosnan does his best here I think he's pretty good in this movie I liked seeing Robbie Coltrane back after having him in Goldeneye there are things about this movie that I definitely appreciate I think the villains a lot stronger than the [ __ ] guy who's gonna control the media or and I appreciated that bond does some really cold-blooded [ __ ] in this movie he doesn't feel like he's having a good time he seems kind of pissed for a lot of the film and I appreciated that but it also suffers from some late 90s effects there's a sequence where they're going through a tunnel on this [ __ ] thing I don't even know what it is the green screen is pretty rough and as I said there's some staging of the action sequences that could have been improved significantly I wasn't there obviously but it feels to me like relying on the second unit to just get it done that's how it feels to me and I think that was a poor choice still I actually think the world is not enough is kind of an underrated Bond movie I'm gonna give the film of b-minus so I've got one more bond review coming for you guys in a couple days which one could it be well I'll give you a hint it's license to kill guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck mine eyes ,1
"""https://youtu.be/zXmHx-9-maM""",Quantum of Solace,Quantum of Solace was directed by Marc Forster and once again star Daniel Craig returning in the role after the incredible Casino Royale and this film was actually a sequel bond is out for revenge after the tragic loss he faced in Casino Royale he's after an organization he believes may have been responsible for it so this film was being made during a writer strike and because of that the script was unfinished and they began shooting the film anyway and Daniel Craig and the director Marc Forster actually rewrote scenes themselves because legally they could not ask a real writer to do it and Craig was quoted as saying we had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writer strike and there was nothing we could do we couldn't employ a writer to finish it I say to myself never again but who knows there was me trying to rewrite scenes and a writer I am NOT so because of this strike and what they had to resort to to make this movie this is a very unique Bond movie it's very short it's only like an hour and 46 minutes long even at that run time though this movie feels [ __ ] boring Quantum of Solace is one of the most listless Bond films I've ever seen the film is chocked full with intense action it's a very violent Bond movie there's not a lot of elegance to it which is something that's missing from this movie bond is supposed to feel almost royal you know you should feel there's some dignity to a James Bond movie now I love Casino Royale and it's super [ __ ] violent but this movie feels mean the violence in the movie just comes off as action sequences it feels at times like a Jason Bourne movie one of my biggest issues with Quantum of Solace is unfortunately the direction coming off of Casino Royale they had an amazing roadmap to follow not that Marc Forster has to sacrifice a vision and just pretend like he's Martin Campbell I'm just saying that that was a two-and-a-half-hour movie with brilliant action wide shots long takes great character work incredible arcs for everyone involved it was tragic it was suspenseful and it was also super violent Quantum of Solace took all the wrong lessons from Casino Royale it was like well we have a new gritty bond and everyone likes it so we're gonna do away with a lot of the humor we're gonna do away with the jokes women are gonna have weird names the villain is gonna be named Dominic Greene he's not gonna have scarring or missing an ear or anything he's just gonna be like a guy who operates out of a shipping pier this is not what Casino Royale did I actually watched Casino Royale again last night and then Quantum of Solace directly after that because I wanted to really feel both of them in a row and watching one after the other this is a gargantuan step down in virtually every way Daniel Craig remains great as bond he's really likable he's charming he's great in the action scenes he's wonderful in this film virtually everything else is worse and the impact of that lesser quality is felt even greater because this is a direct sequel it's not just the next Bond movie it's actually continuing the story Casino Royale has a similar misconception about it that Batman Begins does both of them were viewed as dark and gritty reboot switch in a way they absolutely are both of those films though are filled with humor there's tons of jokes in Batman Begins and there's tons of jokes in Casino Royale there's tons of moments that make you smile and then make you feel like you're watching a film that's meant to make you happy and make you excited Quantum of Solace took the headline appeal of Casino Royale the fact that it was a new dark and gritty reboot and that's all people talked about and they thought okay we'll double down on that and in so doing they made a movie that's completely indistinguishable from almost every other spy action thriller out this isn't supposed to feel like a Jason Bourne movie but in many ways it does and one of the lesser ones for sure the action sequences in this movie are a travesty they're edited so poorly with so much quick cutting it's like you can't actually tell what's happening there are specific scenes when re watching it that I genuinely did not know how something happened there was just a flurry of sound effects and movement and and I suppose that was supposed to tell me that somebody was punched or a car crash or an explosion happened but there's so much missing information because of this technique that sometimes you genuinely cannot tell what the [ __ ] is going on which tells me that mark Forrester was not the right director for this movie and I'm a fan of his I like his film stay I liked Finding Neverland I think he's a really great filmmaker but when it comes to a Bond film it's clear that he didn't really know what the franchise needs in fact he was quoted as saying that he wasn't really a big fan of the James Bond movies up until Casino Royale which is fine that's totally fine that could actually be interesting to take somebody who who has really no attachment to the character has no expectations for what a Bond film should be and say hey what's your viewpoint of a Bond film that could be really cool unfortunately his viewpoint of a Bond film is a our 46 minute spy thriller where people have boring conversations and sometimes people get punched in the face but you can't quite [ __ ] tell I'd also like to talk about the opening title sequence this one is not that great the instrumental portion of it is really good I just don't like the lyrics or the vocals I don't think the performances are all that special interestingly Shirley Bassey who has done a lot of Bond themes and is known for them did a song that many suspect could have potentially been at least in contention as a Quantum of Solace theme it was written by David Arnold who composed the music for this movie it has the word solace in the chorus multiple times and the timing is right for when it could have come out David Arnold has said it wasn't rejected and that was fans speculation but in my opinion there's just too many coincidences even if it wasn't rejected I believe it maybe was at least being considered perhaps and it is much better than what's in this movie check out it's on YouTube and you can tell this film just wasn't scripted properly it needed multiple more drafts there's information that just doesn't really make sense for instance bond says that he didn't think Vesper was the sentimental type which is why I did a DNA check on a lock of his hair found in vespers apartment it's not him a lock of his hair I wouldn't have thought Vesper the sentimental type although there's quite a bit of time given to the fact that in Casino Royale she's wearing a necklace from a former boyfriend and he references it quite often in Casino Royale and thinks about it and you can really feel throughout the entire first act of this film that they don't know where they're going every scene seems to lead to an action set piece there's the opening car chase because apparently he had to leave mr. White's house with a bunch of machine guns blazing even though we know there's no danger it's just a horrible quick cut edited sequence this leads to one of Em's men revealing himself as a traitor and a chase of cross rooftops that doesn't even hold a candle to the freerunning chase in Casino Royale and then bond is on the trail of somebody else and that leads to a fight sequence on a balcony and at this point we're like 25 minutes to a half an hour through the movie and all we really know is that somebody was behind vespers killing and there's traitors in mi6 what did he [ __ ] do there's just there's no story here it'd be one thing if the action sequences were amazing but they're not they are they're actually maddening they really piss you off if you like well filmed action this movie came out right in that time period where Hollywood thought everyone wanted their movies to look like Bourne or taken like every action movie just has to be this way there was this horrible string of terrible action sequences and movies like Columbiana or basically anything directed by Olivier Megaton and Quantum of Solace falls right in there and about halfway through the film you begin to realize how small-scale this film really is it doesn't seem to have any grand desires to tell a story beyond something that's so so minuscule and it can't focus on what could be a very intimate story for Bond this could be very personal for him but the film doesn't have a focus on that there's so many sequences with New Bond girls or this opera sequence where he's spying on people from this quantum organization it sort of just feels like a Saturday afternoon for bond like nothing particularly special is happening in his life even though this is supposed to be something that's very very personal to him it just doesn't come off that way the film also had a Goldfinger homage where gem Arterton is covered in oil the director mentioned that he used that as sort of like a visual metaphor to suggest that the world's most precious resource is no longer gold its oil okay well at school it didn't really work sorry Quantum of Solace is one of the biggest missed opportunities in franchise film I'm not exactly sure why they chose to make this movie even though they were in the middle of a writer's strike I don't think it was like they had to make a movie or they were going to lose the rights to the character if that was the case okay I understand that but I just feel like they should have waited until the strike was over just wait until you have a script don't follow up the best Bond movie of all time with this I'm gonna give Quantum of Solace a c-minus I'm well aware that some people enjoy this movie and that's cool if you like it great I think it's a terrible Bond movie I think it has the appeal of Daniel Craig and honestly that's about it as a story I find it incredibly boring and all the things that you would have expected coming off of what would have been an act of revenge throughout an entire movie it just kind of thrown out the window with boring villains and boring characters and and no real plot and when I say that I understand the movie has a plot of course like characters go places and they talk about things that doesn't mean it actually has one guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and as always if you liked this you can click right here and get stuck mine eyes ,0
"""https://youtu.be/iWXocrQJs0U""",Die Another Day,die another day was Pierce Brosnan's final film as James Bond and since no time to die was originally going to come out this week I thought it'd be fun to fill up this week with some James Bond reviews to pretend like James Bond is still around at least until November when we can hopefully watch that film in cinemas together Brosnan's fourth and final film came out in 2002 and it begins with him surfing into North Korea that should have been a pretty big indicator that this was gonna go south really fast bonds on North Korea trying to hunt down this ruthless terrorist he leads him on a merry chase across a minefield with some hover cars and eventually the terrorist is killed after that Bond is imprisoned in North Korea and tortured with scorpions and all kinds of fucked-up [ __ ] including Madonna's opening theme song which is another form of torture definitely a bad bond theme song and to make matters worse Madonna was also given a cameo in the film and the entire scene is like the biggest eye winking at you see you handle your weapon Wow I have been known to keep my tip up here's the thing about Die Another Day it's definitely Brosnan's worst Bond film it's even his least favorite of the ones he did he argued with the producers that the gadgets were getting too involved too crazy and that it should go back to the darker roots of Ian Fleming's novels clearly he wasn't a fan of this movie strange thing about it is it's not the most boring of his films for me Tomorrow Never Dies it's actually the most boring of the four movies he did it's not the worst it's just the least interesting the villain is like some tech mogul Teri Hatcher's in it it's it's just like the exact same thing happened to Pierce Brosnan that happened to Daniel Craig Martin Campbell came in there made a [ __ ] great movie with Goldeneye and Casino Royale and then somebody else came in and said yeah I'm gonna make tomorrow never dies in Quantum of Solace sorry Martin Campbell we know you gave us an easy path but we [ __ ] you so despite how silly and over-the-top Die Another Day is the best thing I can say about it is that it's not boring something's always happening you can always at least look at the movie and kind of laugh at some of the absurdities there's a few action set pieces that are actually kind of good the opening minefield Chase is not too bad there's an OK sword fight with bond and the main villain Gustav graves which I'll definitely talk about him later in the video have many things to say about that story of mine but for the most part out of all of Brosnan's films this is the closest that actually resembles Austin Powers for instance this film introduced an invisible car and there's a car chase across ice that uses like ten thousand Rockets and a [ __ ] satellite called Icarus that the main villain has constructed in space that reflects the light of the Sun down to the earth and his excuses that it will allow countries that don't have sunlight for certain times of the year to have crops during those times but in reality he just wants to use a giant [ __ ] beam of sunlight and trust me I haven't even gotten to the really silly stuff yet we'll get there don't worry well bond is investigating things in the movie which by the way I just want to say it's kind of hard to follow what he's actually doing we understand that somebody may be kind of sort of betrayed him in the opening scene which caused him to be tortured for many months sort of because somebody says it once like oh I've been betrayed by someone someone betrayed you yes I was betrayed I'm like wait what the film is attempting to have a plot it's attempting to have a narrative of some kind that you can follow and understand with character elements that shift around and that are interesting there's intrigue and spy stuff but it really doesn't care about any of that it really really doesn't what this movie is really interested in is excess it was desperately trying to make bond feel relevant and modern and apparently their idea of that was just shoving everything into a movie having invisible cars and all kinds of [ __ ] nonsense so let's talk a little bit about Halle Berry if you saw John wick 3 you know that Halle Berry is more than capable of doing awesome stuff on screen she was given a great opportunity in that movie to showcase a lot of skills and a lot of training and she was [ __ ] badass but in some of her early 2000s action film attempts like Catwoman and Die Another Day these screenwriters the producers who ever nobody really trusted her to do much she got to kick a couple people in the face so long as she took her clothes off before she did it for instance there's a fight scene at the end of this movie with Rosamund Pike and Halle Berry and Rosamund Pike just shows up looking like Elektra or something for no reason there's no explanation for why she's dressed like that and and they just start [ __ ] fighting it's kind of man the early 2000s I should talk about Pierce Brosnan because I do love him as Bond I think he's excellent in Goldeneye and even in some of his lesser films I think he's still really good and I still think he's really good as bond in this movie he's giving it his all he's trying really hard to in the action scenes he gives a lot he does a lot of the stunt work himself you can see some takes where he does some of his stuff but he's surrounded by noise you can't really hone in on anything every time he gets to have an actual conversation with somebody it's usually a bunch of sexual innuendos I take it mr. Barnes been explaining his Big Bang Theory oh yeah I think I got the rest of it but I think it's time we discuss what I really am excited to talk about and that is the twist of the movie so if you've never seen this film I'm gonna get into some spoilers the main villain of the film a British man who's definitely white isn't actually in reality the North Korean terrorist from the beginning that we thought was dead has gone through a number of procedures to make him look like this man this was only like 18 years ago holy [ __ ] Jesus Christ pushing aside the obvious issues with this storyline that is dumb that is stupid that is just a very dumb idea there's like the surprise of it was was less about the story like what they setup and more of like he actually did that what were you thinking and he's wearing like a Power Rangers suit and he electrocutes people including his father and you can see the [ __ ] electricity of course like it's Star Wars and this entire finale sequence that builds from this Icarus satellite beaming the sunlight down to the earth melting the [ __ ] ice behind bond leading to him surfing on a piece of that vehicle this film completely lost its mind when it comes to Pierce Brosnan's movies goldeneyes obviously the best one I love that movie Tomorrow Never Dies and the world is not enough you can talk about them and I'll probably review them one day but die another day and Gould and I are the ones that are the most interesting to talk about because this one is just so [ __ ] nuts and goldeneyes actually really good I flirted with just making a hilarious 'ti of this movie but honestly there's enough quality elements to the film's production to Pierce Brosnan's performance and there's a few action scenes that are alright David Arnold's score is pretty good David Arnold is still my favorite James Bond composer I wish someone would bring him back his last film was Quantum of Solace his score for Casino Royale is [ __ ] underrated just listen to it it's all on YouTube it's great die another day is well it's I'm gonna give daya nother day a d-plus so guys stay tuned for the rest of this week I'm gonna have at least one more James Bond review for you I'll try to do two but at least one for sure look forward to that guys thank you so much as always for watching and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck mine eyes ,0
"""https://youtu.be/AaHBX-VUc3o""",Black Christmas (2019),black Christmas was directed by Sophia to call and co-written by her an April wolf this film came out last December and I did actually get a chance to see it in theaters but I waited a while to review and I'll tell you why after I talk about the plot this is now the second remake of the original 1974 film the other came out in 2006 and this is a reimagining of that original film about a group of sorority sisters who on Christmas break discover an underground college conspiracy so I had a chance to see this film back on it was in theaters around Christmas time but I didn't review it until now because I noticed that when it first came out there was quite a bit of shall we say anger surrounding the movie a lot of reviews seemed really skewed a lot of people were just giving really vague reviews that didn't seem authentic like they were just upset because the movie is a very feminist film and I just didn't want to pile on to that I thought you know I'll just kind of back off and review this when some of that cools down and try to approach the film from a constructive perspective rather than being one of those people that piles on having said all that I hated this movie I think it's a horrific ly bad horror film and I think it's a really terrible remake this movie had a very rushed production it was announced in June 2019 that a black Christmas remake would be made by blum house and that's Sophia to call one of the directors of an episode of the hula show into the dark would be helming the film that was June the finished movie came out in December we're talking pre-production production and post that son heard of especially for a big movie from a big studio and when you watch the film you can definitely tell how rushed it was shots don't feel very planned they feel sort of in the moment happening like right in front of you without a lot of dictation about where things should go it seems like even the camerawork is mostly just handheld the whole time and there's not a lot of ingenuity to the way the movie looks the cinematography and the lighting is acceptable but the entire finished product feels like it was just rushed out into theatres as quick as possible now since this movie's been out for a while I'm actually gonna get into spoilers because I have so many things I want to talk about and these are things I don't usually like to talk about on my channel I just don't enjoy it there's so much hatred and anger out there for some of these topics and I don't like being part of that but this is what this movie is about and me discussing it it's unavoidable I've now seen this film twice once in theaters and then again on digital with a friend of mine because I wanted to have a refresher so I've paid for the movie twice I've seen it twice I took a bunch of notes before I get into the movies messages and it's themes I'd like to simply talk about it as a horror film first there are certain things that you expect to see in a horror movie especially one of this type that's a slasher technically or at least it is a reimagining of a slasher you expect to see some kills there should be some thrills some tension some suspense and you should feel worried about these characters there should be white-knuckle moments where you think they're going to die or where you feel as if they're in danger you should care about your characters at least somewhat as a horror fan and a film lover I don't need all my films to be the same I don't expect a final girl I don't expect every horror film to be rated R in fact I have adamantly talked about how that is not necessary to create a scary film in the past there are plenty of pg-13 movies like insidious or the American remake of the ring or signs that have scared me that's unnecessary in my opinion but in a film that's remaking black Christmas especially on the heels of the 2006 version which is [ __ ] brutal by the way an extremely gory to have this film be pg-13 I thought was a mistake just about every scare sequence feels truncated by that rating you can tell they're editing around sequences that might include blood to maintain that rating there are scenes with missing information where they have cut a specific moment for the rating and you're not exactly sure what has happened to a character for all these reasons this movie feels very safe it feels very crowd friendly like they're trying to appeal to the widest broadest audience possible to be able to get as many young people in the theater as they can but it creates a disservice to their film because you don't need blood for a movie to be scary but you do need to understand what's happening to these characters you need to have some kind of notion of the danger or the threat and when you can't see anything that's happening or that has happened to a victim it takes all that away pushing the violence aside the films jump scares and scare tactics are so overused we've seen them a thousand times I'd be very surprised if anybody was surprised or startled by that you can you can see it coming a mile away and most of the scares in this movie are like that the hand on someone's shoulder that you can't see has been parodied so many times at this point there are moments throughout the 2019 black Christmas that I begin to think it's a satire I don't know how else to describe the complete incompetence on display when it comes to horror I don't know how else to describe this amount of money being put into a project that has nothing new to offer the horror genre and in what is perhaps the most blatant ripoff I've ever seen of a scare in a film there's an entire sequence that I guess they were trying to pay homage to Exorcist 3 which by the way I love and is extremely underrated if you've never seen it definitely check it out I'd love to review it one day there's a scene in this movie where a character is going in and out of some rooms looking for something and it plays out like this if you've ever seen the Exorcist three you probably remember what has since become the most iconic scare scene in that film there's a difference between homage and ripoff you can have something that reminds you of something you love that makes you smile that makes you excited about something that maybe you feel nostalgic for or you understand the filmmaker is in some way excited or nostalgic or or wants to tribute something in this case though it's just the scene redone in this film poorly what I'd also like to talk about this movie is the use of exposition and how it's delivered to characters to tell a story seriously he was into the dark arts and she already like killed disobedient women in ritual sacrifices to male pagan gods entire scenes are dictated not for character but for exposition for instance after the first big attack happens on our lead characters they run into a car and they drive away the only thing they talk about throughout the entirety of this scene is their theories they both suddenly start speculating about what could be happening and naturally they're very accurate oh those guys something crazy is going on yeah no [ __ ] a bunch of dudes just try to kill us no I mean I saw that guy before the night of the talent show ritual with the pledges it's a friend pledges pledge friends know this felt different it was like they were doing something with this black stuff that was coming out of the founders bust I you slow movie was like black magic or sorcery or something so you're telling me you think the dko boys possessed their pledges in some some supernatural hazing ritual pledges face you saw his blood I don't know what he was but he was changed he wasn't human tell me how think the bust gets brought into the founders fraternity Brian Huntley turns up to meet with the new pledges and then we all start getting these messages from a Calvin Hawthorne account Linsey goes missing Helena goes missing Marty and Jessi are dead thanks for the tip I mean all of this leads back to DK up I need you to help me I need you to create a distraction so that I can sneak into the room where they were holding the ceremony and get to the bust because that is where the power is coming from a magical bust no we're going to the cops what are we going to tell them I would like to remind you that we just killed three people who possessed or not are lying dead in our house right now so you're telling me that this is what's happening yes that's exactly actually what I'm saying did you hear me when I said that this is what's happening just in case you missed it stupid audience members this is what's happening right now this is the type of writing that I think is maybe the most offensive to me I don't like going to a movie and feeling like the writer director doesn't think I'm going to understand or thinks that I have to be spoon-fed I really wish that more writers would respect audience members and trust that they will understand things as they play out that just because you're making a film for a wide audience for a lot of people to come see it doesn't mean everyone is gonna see it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] now that I got the way the dialogue is delivered aside and the failure of a horror film that I believe it to be I'd like to talk about the film's messages the themes what they're trying to communicate to the audience this is obviously a film that is fiercely feminist in every way so the lead character in the film is played by emo gene pool and we learned quickly that she was sexually assaulted in the past by another student on campus and the implication in the film is that she was drugged beforehand and this [ __ ] just you know jokes about it thinks it's okay thinks it's normal she's had to deal this and it's traumatized her she'll see this guy around campus he makes disgusting looks towards her it's very bothersome it makes you angry it sort of makes you side with her early on she's pretty much the only character in the film that you can feel some sympathy for because you understand where she's coming from and you side with her because that's [ __ ] up but everyone else in the movie is basically an [ __ ] people just walk around and treat everybody like [ __ ] the women talk about the men poorly the men talk about the women poorly there's like two nice people in the movie you have the one male character in the entire film that isn't a complete douchebag there's another male character that's dating one of the leads and he's okay for a while until he gets so frustrated with the conversation that women are having about men what did you girls expect excuse me I told you something like this was gonna happen okay you show Milly ated those guys up there of course they pissed and that gives them an excuse to harass us if a bunch of frat bros had gotten up and sang a song about how I don't women were just bimbo she liked to show off their testing yeah you'd be livid it's a little different how why aren't you allowed to say all the [ __ ] about men and we're supposed to just sit here and take it because men have all the power not all men have powers just not only it's just not oh man Oh rapist Chris okay I'm not here just lumped me in with the bad ones because I'm a man nobody is calling you rapist fight with your men a man hating what did I say that was so offensive just calm down I'm trying to have a real calm down you want me to calm down let's calm down you just what would you do [Laughter] you serious I showed you that scene for a reason it's to hammer down a point this movie for the most part plays out like a long drawn-out Twitter feud everyone in this movie says social media buzz words constantly it feels as if it's written like people are talking on social media there is such a disconnect now between people who almost exist on social media and people who are existing in the real world while sometimes also posting on Facebook or Twitter that people begin to think that this is actually how people talk and interact in real life because you're so sucked into this social media world that now we have a film where every character talks as if they have a character limit to everything they say now that's understandable when you have like your basic Hollywood slasher the character is in Halloween for instance there nothing to write home about Laurie Strode is awesome because Halloween's awesome and Jamie Lee Curtis is awesome but as a character there's not much there but when you have a film that is going for so much more that is trying to say so much more that is trying to be important for a lot of people specifically women and young girls to have characters this dry and this bland is a giant mistake now the film opens with a murder sequence it takes quite a long time before we understand how this connects to the main story Jaws for instance opens with a murder we understand that more than likely the shark has taken this girl but quickly we are investigating this murder with chief Brody we are looking into this murder we're wondering what happened this film seems to have some sort of disconnect with its opening scene that doesn't really seem to add anything to the story except it suggests that there's some [ __ ] up [ __ ] happening on campus but barely anyone's even talking about it or mentioning it it doesn't even feel like a murder or at least someone missing has occurred and when the film came out I saw plenty of people who were reviewing the film saying be quiet this isn't for you this is not for men I don't care what men have to say about this film this is a film for women I don't understand the notion of completely alienating an entire gender from a movie I think that if you want to have a message heard and if in your film the villains the people who are making it hard for that message to be heard are all men wouldn't you want men to relate to understand to feel empathy to feel some kind of connection where they could leave the theater and go I completely understand another reason I have a hard time relating to these characters is that for the majority of the film they do nothing but pity themselves it doesn't matter who the characters are in a movie if it's a children's animation and it's like at a zoo or something if the lead characters do nothing but talk about how their life sucks for the entire film it's going to get annoying it's very difficult to want to continue to root for people like that because you would like to see them attempt to get out of these situations and finally within the last five minutes they do so let's talk about what's really going on at this college who's responsible for all of these murders the strange text messages that Reilly the lead character is receiving early on in the film we meet Cary Elwes he's playing a professor who is teaching some things that students are feeling uncomfortable about there's a petition going around to get him fired from his job as it turns out he is also the leader of this long-standing cult of men at this college who used black magic to give themselves supernatural powers and their entire goal is to basically take back the throne and eventually go into the courts and display dominance over women and we learn all of this because the bad guy decides to give an epic speech in which he explains his evil plan to the lead character while she's tied up does he do this with all of his victims or just our lead character so that we can understand what's happening you see when your friend miss Watterson had the founders statue removed and brought here the boys discovered something magical hidden inside towards the end of his life Hawthorne force or the threat posed by women what so he took precautions in case they strayed too far out of your way a master of the dark hearts he left instructions on how to create an army of young men to take our power back your holy say no no not insane mister simply men were tired of seeing ourselves falsely accused our livelihoods threatened marginalized and belittled reduced to spectators in our own lives what upon graduation our army will venture into courtrooms boardrooms and the halls of Congress to set the world right I can't believe in this movie the bad guy actually explains his evil plan this is like some 1980s Mystery Science Theater 3000 [ __ ] this is satire it's gotta [ __ ] be if it's not this is truly [ __ ] embarrassing but after loathing their existence for the entire film the characters finally stand up for themselves and an Avengers slow-motion action sequence breaks out where they're all fighting with bow and arrows and Riley takes the bust of the professor that founded this college destroys it and I guess that ends the black magic they all run out of the building and everyone in it burns alive and the film just instantly ends now what do you think is gonna happen do you think that they're just gonna walk off into the sunset with this College burning to the ground with tons of bodies inside of it I feel like it would have been easier if they had just gone to the police before and said look some real shits going on you can't ignore this but now they have to not only explain that but also the burnt down College with all of the dead bodies so let's backtrack a minute and look at exactly what this ending is telling us it's already been made abundantly clear that these guys in this cult have been possessed by some kind of black magic black liquid that's coming out of the founders bust earlier in the film Riley witnessed one student trying to join the fraternity have to go through a hazing ritual that ended up being that student being possessed by said black magic meaning that this guy has no idea what's going on thinks he's just joining a fraternity and is also being preyed upon by the higher-ups at d.ko now it's obvious that Cary Elwes character and some of the men in this cult are no good and I wouldn't cry tear if they all burned alive at the end of a fictional movie but that's not what happens here after the black magic curse is lifted and they all are fully conscious of their surroundings and know exactly what's happening and are no longer possessed by this evil they all burn alive and the writers have also showed us that humanity is restored to the people when the curse is lifted because the one nice male character in the film that has a crush on Riley and Riley has a crush on him is saved and he's there with the girls as they watch the college and all of the men inside of it burned down I'd be curious to know how many of these students that are currently burning alive at the end of this movie even knew what they were doing how many of them had free will or control over their actions or their mind so the message here is really clear to me just burn it all down I don't see how this is an ending for any of these characters I think this movie fails completely as a horror film I was never scared once I never felt anything for the characters the action was incomprehensible you could hardly tell exactly what was happening it was so edited down you barely got a sense of what was really going on in those scenes in fact and the scares were like non-existent some of the cheapest most overused scares you've seen in horror but as a film with a message you can't miss it it's as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face it really wants you to hear everything they have to say it's like a social media post that's being sponsored and bumped up so everyone on Twitter or Facebook can see it I don't understand what happened with this movie I think as remake it's possibly offensive like it's basically just taking the name of a cult classic horror movie and slapping it onto a different story entirely it'd be like remaking Halloween but just having it be like some guy I'm gonna give black Christmas an F there's no easy way for me to sit here and review this movie constructively because I know that there are so many defenses that can be thrown at me for this review it's not made for me I'm a man so it doesn't count again not made for me I didn't understand it I must be sexist or misogynist or a lot of other things that just aren't [ __ ] true but I feel like that is some kind of shield that is put up around entertainment like this that's not fair every thing that's made in the entertainment world is open to constructive criticism it doesn't matter who made it it's an art piece and it's open to that and I feel like I was way nicer and way more fair than a lot of the reviews I've read so I wouldn't really recommend seeing this movie especially if you're a fan of the first film I would recommend that first film and you know what the 2006 version gets a lot of hate I don't really understand why it is kind of unnecessarily mean-spirited but it's a really well-made horror film it's surprisingly not that bad I would recommend checking that out sometime guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this you can click right

"""https://youtu.be/UTfL6DJI0-M""",Zombieland: Double Tap,Zombieland double tap is once again directed by ruben fleischer and stars Woody Harrelson Jesse Eisenberg Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as well as rosario Dawson Luke Wilson ten years after the first one the four of them are still trying to survive in a world overrun by zombies and now they're hanging out at the White House and as the four of them begin to argue and separate newer more evolved zombies that are much harder to kill appear I like the first zombie land it's a very entertaining movie I've never felt like watching it a lot it has sequences that I love I adore the Bill Murray stuff I think that's really funny the characters for the most part are likable it's easy film to watch but I've never been in love with the first movie I thought it was just good I own it I liked it and so I for some reason I missed this movie I think I was on a trip or something I can't even remember but last year I didn't get a chance to see the film and I didn't see it after that because there was a whole bunch of other stuff to review afterwards but I finally saw it and I'm glad I did because this film is OK I heard really bad things about it strangely from major fans of the first film perhaps since I'm not as big a fan of the first I was okay with this movie more so than most my favorite part of the film is Woody Harrelson he's great as Tallahassee he's easily the most likeable character in the whole movie forced to ride in a van that he hates for most of the film and hoping that he can eventually find Elvis's Graceland and it was actually kind of refreshing to see Jesse Eisenberg not as like an overly neurotic nervous cynical person he's got a smile on his face for most of the movie he's like a happy presence of joy which I'm so not used to seeing him play but my biggest issue with the film by far is its use of a soap opera like love triangle between Jesse Eisenberg Emma Stone and Zoe dutchboy I'm not exactly sure how to pronounce her last name actually she's great in the movie she is really funny she plays a character that might be a few cans short of a six-pack so to speak but she's really good in the movie and very funny but this love triangle that develops feels so forced and abrupt it feels so written Jesse Eisenberg proposes to Emma Stone and she gets so freaked out that even though she's been with him for 10 [ __ ] years she just leaves and leave no I just found that so abrupt and and very unbelievable I just didn't feel like it was earned really and because of that arguments go back and forth between the movie and unnecessary bickering it feels like they just didn't know what else to do with these characters it feels like they all had a nice ending in the first film and now they're just trying to find excuses to make them at odds with one another which doesn't really make sense since they have been surviving like a family for the past ten years in a post-apocalyptic world with nothing but zombies and I just don't buy that they're all so easily torn apart like that and sometimes the action sequences can feel like hey we need one of those all right we'll have one let's let's have like a three-minute action scene with a bunch of cool kills we needed that it's not that they're boring or anything it just feels like they're sort of going through the motions sometimes with this film it's a sequel that people wanted to see that for the most part is satisfying it's nowhere near as good as the first but it can escape this strange feeling where you're not entirely sure if we actually needed this movie but they did come up with a pretty clever idea for one specific joke where they're talking about a company that maybe should have happened one day they're like what if we had a company where people could just be picked up by strangers and and taken to locations cuz the taxi service is so expensive and people like that's dumb that would never happen it's kind of clever that they can take something like we know as uber pretend like it never existed and then write it into this world as a joke I would have liked to have seen them do actually more with that kind of humor but still Zombieland double-tap was a nice refresher with some characters that I liked it didn't really feel like it earned being a movie but I was still entertained for the most part by it and it also didn't make me upset it didn't feel like it ruined the first film at all it just sort of was a movie that's my professional review I hope you liked it that's the blu-ray quote Zombieland 2 was a movie I'm gonna give Zombieland DoubleTap of be - guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck mine eyes ,1
"""https://youtu.be/ewoIjznbdXo""",The Hunt,the hunt was directed by Craig Sobel the man behind the excellent film compliance and it's a very controversial film that many people refused to see it's a it's a bad movie it's I refused to watch slot it's a movie where people got killed violence politics and I refused mmm movies mmm anger hmm controversy hmm this film was supposed to come out last year until it was pushed back almost indefinitely until it was announced that it would be coming out this March it's about a group of people who wake up in the middle of the woods they don't know where they are they have gags on their mouth and they're being hunted by an unseen force let me just explain something really quick about myself for a second I used to review trailers they get a lot of really easy hits you don't have to go out you can just watch a two-minute trailer and make a three-minute video about it and sometimes get even more views than if you actually reviewed the movie I used to do that a lot back in the day but I stopped doing it and I'll explain why I found myself feeling increasingly uncomfortable with having such an opinion about a movie that I hadn't seen I didn't like doing that it made me feel kind of gross and even though they were great for monetization I just stopped enjoying reviewing trailers because I wanted to actually see the film and talk about the film which is why I tried to distance myself from the controversy that surrounded this movie before anyone had actually seen it but outrage is kind of the thing nowadays it drives a lot of money through this website I'm not a big fan of it I try to stray away from that I mean I just watched Veronica I can deal with anything but let's be really clear this movie is a satire and in the case of satire it's not as clear when there is a joke for some audience members and so some people take satires very seriously and they don't really understand that it's actually just kind of poking fun at something which this movie is for instance there's a scene in the film where they meet a character who has a box in his car with cash and there's an actual label on the box that says bribe money now that's a little bit Leslie Nielsen you know david zucker esque that's not quite as subtle as a lot of the humor in this movie but there are aspects of this movie that let you know that they're just kind of joking around and it's the movies tongue-in-cheek humor combined with really well filmed action sequences and one of the most likable performances I've seen in a long time from Betty Gilpin that made this movie really entertaining for me I think you can watch this movie as an action comedy and be very entertained by it it's consistently investing there's always forward momentum the movie is rarely slow it never drags something is always happening you're always invested in the action of the moment the first act is really surprising you're constantly introduced to a series of characters and you're never entirely sure which one is your lead and they throw a lot of twists in that first act that I didn't expect at all until you start to understand who you're really following here and that's where the movie really picks up because as I said Betty Gilpin she delivers like a star-making performance in this movie think Samara weaving in ready or not like that level of intensity she's also very funny in the movie as this badass from Mississippi that finds herself in the middle of this war and she doesn't even care I was really surprised to see such an entertaining and likeable character in this film now in regards to choosing a political side this movie doesn't really do that it actually Lampoon's just about everyone more than likely if you go to this movie there's going to be a few jokes that are thrown your way but you're also going to be laughing because there's jokes throughout everyone else's way to and so in that way I can see this movie really dividing audiences in fact it's no surprise to me that currently the Rotten Tomatoes score is this basically split this movie will definitely divide audiences but I think it's going to come down to whether or not you can just be entertained by a political satire anymore in 2020 back in the day there were tons of films like this and oftentimes they were aimed at one specific thing and you could kind of latch on to what that was I mean even most recently one of the best movies of the last decade was parasite which is more of a social satire but in that case that movie is about rich versus poor which is an argument that almost universally everybody can understand and it's not really that complex of an argument you're instantly sort of on the underdog side you're not so much on the rich side and you can understand why it's presenting how those issues are difficult for people dealing with that sort of class struggle in the case of a movie like this though this isn't just rich versus poor this is an entire political spectrum and the way we react to things online nowadays especially through social media that's being lampooned and so there's gonna be a lot of people who are gonna raise their hands and say I'm offended by this so since its targets aren't as clear and it basically is aiming at everyone the reaction to this movie is going to be completely polarizing for I would say I don't know at least a year or so because as a film it's very well made and it's very well acted it's just that it's jokes are sometimes so broad that you kind of want them to hone in on something and they're going in a lot of different directions the phone can also over rely on its propulsion and forward movement over building character you have a lot of plot and not a lot of character you don't learn that much about our lead character until the end of the movie and gratefully she's such an entertaining presence and her performance is so good that you can kind of deal with that but I can also see a lot of people being like well I didn't really know anyone in this movie it seemed like a lot of people were just cannon fodder which also makes sense I can understand that complaint as well but I found the hunt very entertaining and I was able to laugh at some of the jokes that were directed at things that I believe and I was able to laugh at some of the jokes that were directed in the other direction too so whether or not people liked this film I think is going to largely rest on whether or not you can see the dark humor in a situation that's rather horrible how much you can take a joke towards your own personal beliefs and whether or not you truly understand what a satire is which is sort of to aim lenz at us we're very used to looking through the lens at others but this movie is asking us to look at ourselves and for some people that's not gonna work sometimes the jokes are far too broad and they don't really land but I do admire the attempt it's nice at least to see a movie that does have a set of balls and and that's becoming less and less apparent nowadays I'm gonna give the hunt a beam as usual I don't really think this film was worth the pre-release controversy or outrage I'm curious for people who have actually seen the film what they think of it guys thank you so much as always for watching if you like this you can click right here and get stuck mine eyes movies mmm anger hmm controversy hmm I just sounded like Yoda the adventure the excitement ,1
"""https://youtu.be/SzpZU_zR34k""",My Hero Academia: Heroes Rising,not subscribers I am here to review my hero macadamia heroes rising my hero academia heroes rising is the second film in this franchise it's in the middle of its fourth season right now and just like the start of every season and both movies I'll recap what this series is about just in case you don't know this takes place in a world where the majority of the population has some kind of superpower they call it a quirk some use their powers for good and some use their powers for evil the show follows the class of students at UA high school a place where they train to become heroes and our lead character is Iizuka midoriya also known as Deku he and the rest of class won a fight against evil alongside heroes like all might this movie takes place on nubu Island a place where the kids are sent for some sort of special hero course while they're there they encounter a villain who's able to use multiple quirks at once and they try to protect the island from him I've never really talked about this show on my channel but I'm a big fan of it I think it's one of the better anime running right now and I really enjoy watching it some seasons aren't as strong as others there are some aspects of the show where it can kind of get slow but when the show really goes all out it's extremely exciting and my two favorite aspects of the show is the mentor-student relationship between Deku and Almighty and the rivalry between Deku and Cotchin and as a fan this movie gave me everything I wanted it gave me a lot of things I wanted to see and a few things I didn't expect that I would the stuff between Cotchin and Deku in this film in particular really satisfied me as I mentioned that relationship is one of my favorites in the show it's similar in a way to Goku and Vegeta and Dragon Ball and this film has sequences where both of them have to figure out a way to overcome their differences to solve a problem and that was very exciting to see for a lot of built-up and pent-up anger over the course of four seasons that being said it's obvious that more than likely this movie isn't going to have much of an impact on the show similar to the first film two heroes they're usually offshoots or one offs that don't impact the main storyline what is why some of the dramatic heft of certain moments in this film is reduced because the movie tries to forget about it really quick and it knows that it shouldn't really affect the show and so it tries to be like hey I know that was really epic but just you know like that was just for this one time okay just don't get ahead of yourselves fans but it was really satisfying to see all of this class working together without any pro hero's present because usually in the show there's a lot of restraint a pro hero is always like you guys go over there we're gonna do our [ __ ] but it's pretty much all the kids on the island and you get to see them work through a lot of things that they've always wanted to work through they get a chance to really shine a lot here every single hero gets a gets a chance to do something cool but also you get to see a sort of blossoming mentor-student relationship someone to what deca Woodall might have with a young boy on the island and deku because this young kid has certain abilities but he's very fearful of showing them and his older sister is also very protective of him but when Deku rescues him he starts to think more about what he can do and you see Deku really come into his own as a mentor as I already said the movie can't really take too many risks because it has to be a one-off even in the final battle when certain things are getting to a point where you're like wow I never expected to see that happen there's always this knowledge that it's not going to actually change the story even so there were character arcs that felt like they were building up over the course of four seasons that this movie addressed and even if this isn't canon I'm not one of those fans that really cares about that to me if it's a good story and you had a good time watching it or reading it if it's a book then it did its job I'm not as concerned about whether or not some official timeline is going to incorporate a story into a narrative that gives me some kind of validation for a story I love Canon has never really been a problem for me as long as whatever it is entertained me then that's enough for me and this movie was a blast I will say the first 20 minutes or so a little slow but it was basically just setting everything up and making sure you understood what they were doing you have to watch the kids on the island sort of solve everyday problems they can use their quirks to jump start a tractor you know and just stuff like that and you're setting up those two young kids and what they're doing on the island but once the main villain appears the movie is almost non-stop action for the rest of it it's similar to Dragon Ball super Broly as soon as the action starts it rarely lets up and it's extremely well animated the music is also excellent the voice work is really good I had a great time with this movie I'm gonna give my hero academia heroes rising and a - I'm just waiting for Deku to at some point in the show just be like Akron smash that'll never happen it's too small of a city but similar to every time I've ever reviewed like a Dragon Ball movie for instance if you aren't initiated with these characters you're not gonna care as much I will say that you could probably at least be entertained by the movie it sets it up well enough to the point where you can sort of follow what's happening but there's a lot of built-up character development in the four seasons that have happened while watching this that's really gonna help so I wouldn't really recommend seeing this in theaters unless you you know these characters and you probably weren't going to anyway but I feel like I have to say that guys thank you so much as always for watching I look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck mine eyes you ,2
"""https://youtu.be/vHaCkkBzWAY""",The Invisible Man,The Invisible Man was directed by Leigh Whannell and stars Elisabeth Moss as a woman fleeing from an abusive boyfriend but when she learns that he's committed suicide and she's inherited five million dollars things seem okay for a while until an invisible force starts to stalk her and she believes this man has found a way to become invisible Leigh Whannell has been one of my favorite people working in movies today since saw having wrote that film and shooting it on such a shoestring budget with James Wan and starring in it then working on insidious and upgrade which he directed which was awesome I was very excited to see this movie but after films like I Frankenstein the Wolfman Dracula untold and The Mummy having another one of universals famous quote-unquote monsters being remade gave me some pause gratefully this is nothing like those movies at all this is a reimagining that works in spades I know that you can technically include the Invisible Man with Frankenstein and the mummy and Dracula and all that but I never really thought they were of the same vein yeah Universal owns rights and there's all kinds of random [ __ ] but I always thought it was more of a sci-fi which is definitely what HD Welles was going for with his original novella and Leigh Whannell has found a way to make this feel very modern this is slight science fiction but it's really more of a horror thriller and at its center is an excellent performance by Elisabeth Moss who continues to impress and everything she does she's really damn good in this movie and you feel for her a lot because you can totally relate to what she's going through even if you're not a woman fleeing from an abusive man more than likely at some point in your life you have felt controlled by someone or gas lighted by someone or someone's made you feel like you're not worth anything and this is why I care so much about her character in this movie because not only that as this invisible man starts to torment her and it becomes apparent that she has to do something about it naturally she can't explain that to anybody nobody understands what she's going through if you say I'm being attacked by an invisible man you just look like a crazy person which is why I'm kind of surprised this reimagining happen sooner because if you were to take that original story and put it in 2020 this is the way to do it it's a smart emotionally effective and cost-effective way to make a movie when you can build so much tension around something that isn't even on set because he constantly films couches or he'll pan away from an actor to the corner of the room and he's suggesting that this guy is sitting in that couch or he's standing in the corner and you start to look around even though you know you're not gonna see him you look for signs that he's there in a lot of scenes where he may not have been and that's due to some really great suggestion with the camera and this movie proves what horror fans and some really good filmmakers have been saying for years and that's that suggesting things with the camera making your audience question what they're looking at introducing some mystery making you lean forward and wonder did I just see what I think I saw that's how you produce good scares it's not about loud noises yeah there are some effective jump scares in this movie but none of them are cheap they're all really well done and the use of sound is really important to this movie because there's plenty of sequences that are very silent and you're almost listening for this guy's breath this movie easily could have been very cheesy but it's committed to the psychological aspect of this horror what it's doing to Elisabeth Moss and what it's doing to her relationships because this guy is super smart and he's got a plan and you can see it all coming into motion like dominoes just toppling perfectly the way he wants them to to make this woman look as crazy as possible but you're on her side so it's kind of an underdog story in a way too I can't sing the directing and the acting enough praises all of that's really good the script is also pretty good there's some good dialogue although there are some plot holes and some inconsistencies about certain things that I don't want to get into because of spoilers but I'll traverse it carefully there's an aspect about transportation how someone is getting to and from places that kind of left me wondering at the end of the movie how exactly that took place there's a very apparent uber driver parked outside someone's gate and I don't how they missed that driver waiting there I I there's just there's certain questions that that I have haven't you seen the movie that that kind of led me down a path of movie logic every movie has that you know where certain things just have to happen and the the filmmaker is hoping you accept it even though it's a bit of a coincidence or it probably wouldn't happen that way in real life there's a scene at a restaurant where if there is just even one security camera the movie ends basically or at least some of the tension ends and there's just a lot of questions that could be easily answered with security cameras and in a film that references security cameras often in someone's house outside someone's house you would think that they would also cover those bases too it's a very easy fix instead of having that scene in a crowded restaurant it could have been in someplace more private but at the same time for it to have its effect it had to be in front of people and so there's just there's questions that sort of relate to movie logic and if you're one of those people like me that sometimes goes hmm I don't know about that there's a few parts of the movie that might bug you but really those moments are few and far between and I don't think it did much at all to detract from my enjoyment of the movie because it was just so well acted and so well made and I respected their reimagining rather than like having Aaron Eckhart fight a bunch of monsters and Tom Cruise run from some [ __ ] bugs what was he running from scorpions I don't [ __ ] know the mummy god damn I'm gonna give the Invisible Man of b-plus I am really excited to see what else Leigh Whannell does I understand he's working on an escape from New
